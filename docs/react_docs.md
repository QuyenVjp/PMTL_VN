<Intro>
React Compiler is a new build-time tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the [Rules of React](/reference/rules), so you don't need to rewrite any code to use it.

## What does React Compiler do? {/*what-does-react-compiler-do*/}

React Compiler automatically optimizes your React application at build time. React is often fast enough without optimization, but sometimes you need to manually memoize components and values to keep your app responsive. This manual memoization is tedious, easy to get wrong, and adds extra code to maintain. React Compiler does this optimization automatically for you, freeing you from this mental burden so you can focus on building features.

### Before React Compiler {/*before-react-compiler*/}

Without the compiler, you need to manually memoize components and values to optimize re-renders:

```js
import { useMemo, useCallback, memo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ data, onClick }) {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return expensiveProcessing(data);
  }, [data]);

  const handleClick = useCallback((item) => {
    onClick(item.id);
  }, [onClick]);

  return (
    <div>
      {processedData.map(item => (
        <Item key={item.id} onClick={() => handleClick(item)} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
});
```


<Note>

This manual memoization has a subtle bug that breaks memoization:

```js [[2, 1, "() => handleClick(item)"]]
<Item key={item.id} onClick={() => handleClick(item)} />
```

Even though `handleClick` is wrapped in `useCallback`, the arrow function `() => handleClick(item)` creates a new function every time the component renders. This means that `Item` will always receive a new `onClick` prop, breaking memoization.

React Compiler is able to optimize this correctly with or without the arrow function, ensuring that `Item` only re-renders when `props.onClick` changes.

</Note>

### After React Compiler {/*after-react-compiler*/}

With React Compiler, you write the same code without manual memoization:

```js
function ExpensiveComponent({ data, onClick }) {
  const processedData = expensiveProcessing(data);

  const handleClick = (item) => {
    onClick(item.id);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {processedData.map(item => (
        <Item key={item.id} onClick={() => handleClick(item)} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

_[See this example in the React Compiler Playground](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAMygOzgFwJYSYAEAogB4AOCmYeAbggMIQC2Fh1OAFMEQCYBDHAIA0RQowA2eOAGsiAXwCURYAB1iROITA4iFGBERgwCPgBEhAogF4iCStVoMACoeO1MAcy6DhSgG4NDSItHT0ACwFMPkkmaTlbIi48HAQWFRsAPlUQ0PFMKRlZFLSWADo8PkC8hSDMPJgEHFhiLjzQgB4+eiyO-OADIwQTM0thcpYBClL02xz2zXz8zoBJMqJZBABPG2BU9Mq+BQKiuT2uTJyomLizkoOMk4B6PqX8pSUFfs7nnro3qEapgFCAFEA)_

React Compiler automatically applies the optimal memoization, ensuring your app only re-renders when necessary.

<DeepDive>
#### What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? {/*what-kind-of-memoization-does-react-compiler-add*/}

React Compiler's automatic memoization is primarily focused on **improving update performance** (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases:

1. **Skipping cascading re-rendering of components**
    * Re-rendering `<Parent />` causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only `<Parent />` has changed
1. **Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React**
    * For example, calling `expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects()` inside of your component or hook that needs that data

#### Optimizing Re-renders {/*optimizing-re-renders*/}

React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component's state changes, React will re-render that component _and all of its children_ — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with `useMemo()`, `useCallback()`, or `React.memo()`. For example, in the following example, `<MessageButton>` will re-render whenever `<FriendList>`'s state changes:

```javascript
function FriendList({ friends }) {
  const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount();
  if (friends.length === 0) {
    return <NoFriends />;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <span>{onlineCount} online</span>
      {friends.map((friend) => (
        <FriendListCard key={friend.id} friend={friend} />
      ))}
      <MessageButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```
[_See this example in the React Compiler Playground_](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAMygOzgFwJYSYAEAYjHgpgCYAyeYOAFMEWuZVWEQL4CURwADrEicQgyKEANnkwIAwtEw4iAXiJQwCMhWoB5TDLmKsTXgG5hRInjRFGbXZwB0UygHMcACzWr1ABn4hEWsYBBxYYgAeADkIHQ4uAHoAPksRbisiMIiYYkYs6yiqPAA3FMLrIiiwAAcAQ0wU4GlZBSUcbklDNqikusaKkKrgR0TnAFt62sYHdmp+VRT7SqrqhOo6Bnl6mCoiAGsEAE9VUfmqZzwqLrHqM7ubolTVol5eTOGigFkEMDB6u4EAAhKA4HCEZ5DNZ9ErlLIWYTcEDcIA)

React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as "fine-grained reactivity". In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of `<FriendListCard />` can be reused even as `friends` changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX _and_ avoid re-rendering `<MessageButton>` as the count changes.

#### Expensive calculations also get memoized {/*expensive-calculations-also-get-memoized*/}

React Compiler can also automatically memoize expensive calculations used during rendering:

```js
// **Not** memoized by React Compiler, since this is not a component or hook
function expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() { /* ... */ }

// Memoized by React Compiler since this is a component
function TableContainer({ items }) {
  // This function call would be memoized:
  const data = expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects(items);
  // ...
}
```
[_See this example in the React Compiler Playground_](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAejQAgFTYHIQAuumAtgqRAJYBeCAJpgEYCemASggIZyGYDCEUgAcqAGwQwANJjBUAdokyEAFlTCZ1meUUxdMcIcIjyE8vhBiYVECAGsAOvIBmURYSonMCAB7CzcgBuCGIsAAowEIhgYACCnFxioQAyXDAA5gixMDBcLADyzvlMAFYIvGAAFACUmMCYaNiYAHStOFgAvk5OGJgAshTUdIysHNy8AkbikrIKSqpaWvqGIiZmhE6u7p7ymAAqXEwSguZcCpKV9VSEFBodtcBOmAYmYHz0XIT6ALzefgFUYKhCJRBAxeLcJIsVIZLI5PKFYplCqVa63aoAbm6u0wMAQhFguwAPPRAQA+YAfL4dIloUmBMlODogDpAA)

However, if `expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects` is truly an expensive function, you may want to consider implementing its own memoization outside of React, because:

- React Compiler only memoizes React components and hooks, not every function
- React Compiler's memoization is not shared across multiple components or hooks

So if `expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects` was used in many different components, even if the same exact items were passed down, that expensive calculation would be run repeatedly. We recommend [profiling](reference/react/useMemo#how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive) first to see if it really is that expensive before making code more complicated.
</DeepDive>

## Should I try out the compiler? {/*should-i-try-out-the-compiler*/}

We encourage everyone to start using React Compiler. While the compiler is still an optional addition to React today, in the future some features may require the compiler in order to fully work.

### Is it safe to use? {/*is-it-safe-to-use*/}

React Compiler is now stable and has been tested extensively in production. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you've followed the [Rules of React](/reference/rules).

## What build tools are supported? {/*what-build-tools-are-supported*/}

React Compiler can be installed across [several build tools](/learn/react-compiler/installation) such as Babel, Vite, Metro, and Rsbuild.

React Compiler is primarily a light Babel plugin wrapper around the core compiler, which was designed to be decoupled from Babel itself. While the initial stable version of the compiler will remain primarily a Babel plugin, we are working with the swc and [oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/10048) teams to build first class support for React Compiler so you won't have to add Babel back to your build pipelines in the future.

Next.js users can enable the swc-invoked React Compiler by using [v15.3.1](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v15.3.1) and up.

## What should I do about useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo? {/*what-should-i-do-about-usememo-usecallback-and-reactmemo*/}

By default, React Compiler will memoize your code based on its analysis and heuristics. In most cases, this memoization will be as precise, or moreso, than what you may have written.

However, in some cases developers may need more control over memoization. The `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks can continue to be used with React Compiler as an escape hatch to provide control over which values are memoized. A common use-case for this is if a memoized value is used as an effect dependency, in order to ensure that an effect does not fire repeatedly even when its dependencies do not meaningfully change.

For new code, we recommend relying on the compiler for memoization and using `useMemo`/`useCallback` where needed to achieve precise control.

For existing code, we recommend either leaving existing memoization in place (removing it can change compilation output) or carefully testing before removing the memoization.

title: Installation
---

<Intro>
This guide will help you install and configure React Compiler in your React application.
</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How to install React Compiler
* Basic configuration for different build tools
* How to verify your setup is working

</YouWillLearn>

## Prerequisites {/*prerequisites*/}

React Compiler is designed to work best with React 19, but it also supports React 17 and 18. Learn more about [React version compatibility](/reference/react-compiler/target).

## Installation {/*installation*/}

Install React Compiler as a `devDependency`:

<TerminalBlock>
npm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
</TerminalBlock>

Or with Yarn:

<TerminalBlock>
yarn add -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
</TerminalBlock>

Or with pnpm:

<TerminalBlock>
pnpm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
</TerminalBlock>

## Basic Setup {/*basic-setup*/}

React Compiler is designed to work by default without any configuration. However, if you need to configure it in special circumstances (for example, to target React versions below 19), refer to the [compiler options reference](/reference/react-compiler/configuration).

The setup process depends on your build tool. React Compiler includes a Babel plugin that integrates with your build pipeline.

<Pitfall>
React Compiler must run **first** in your Babel plugin pipeline. The compiler needs the original source information for proper analysis, so it must process your code before other transformations.
</Pitfall>

### Babel {/*babel*/}

Create or update your `babel.config.js`:

```js {3}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'babel-plugin-react-compiler', // must run first!
    // ... other plugins
  ],
  // ... other config
};
```

### Vite {/*vite*/}

If you use Vite, you can add the plugin to vite-plugin-react:

```js {3,9}
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react({
      babel: {
        plugins: ['babel-plugin-react-compiler'],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Alternatively, if you prefer a separate Babel plugin for Vite:

<TerminalBlock>
npm install -D vite-plugin-babel
</TerminalBlock>

```js {2,11}
// vite.config.js
import babel from 'vite-plugin-babel';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    babel({
      babelConfig: {
        plugins: ['babel-plugin-react-compiler'],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Next.js {/*usage-with-nextjs*/}

Please refer to the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/reactCompiler) for more information.

### React Router {/*usage-with-react-router*/}
Install `vite-plugin-babel`, and add the compiler's Babel plugin to it:

<TerminalBlock>
npm install vite-plugin-babel
</TerminalBlock>

```js {3-4,16}
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import babel from "vite-plugin-babel";
import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";

const ReactCompilerConfig = { /* ... */ };

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    reactRouter(),
    babel({
      filter: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
      babelConfig: {
        presets: ["@babel/preset-typescript"], // if you use TypeScript
        plugins: [
          ["babel-plugin-react-compiler", ReactCompilerConfig],
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Webpack {/*usage-with-webpack*/}

A community webpack loader is [now available here](https://github.com/SukkaW/react-compiler-webpack).

### Expo {/*usage-with-expo*/}

Please refer to [Expo's docs](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/) to enable and use the React Compiler in Expo apps.

### Metro (React Native) {/*usage-with-react-native-metro*/}

React Native uses Babel via Metro, so refer to the [Usage with Babel](#babel) section for installation instructions.

### Rspack {/*usage-with-rspack*/}

Please refer to [Rspack's docs](https://rspack.dev/guide/tech/react#react-compiler) to enable and use the React Compiler in Rspack apps.

### Rsbuild {/*usage-with-rsbuild*/}

Please refer to [Rsbuild's docs](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/framework/react#react-compiler) to enable and use the React Compiler in Rsbuild apps.


## ESLint Integration {/*eslint-integration*/}

React Compiler includes an ESLint rule that helps identify code that can't be optimized. When the ESLint rule reports an error, it means the compiler will skip optimizing that specific component or hook. This is safe: the compiler will continue optimizing other parts of your codebase. You don't need to fix all violations immediately. Address them at your own pace to gradually increase the number of optimized components.

Install the ESLint plugin:

<TerminalBlock>
npm install -D eslint-plugin-react-hooks@latest
</TerminalBlock>

If you haven't already configured eslint-plugin-react-hooks, follow the [installation instructions in the readme](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/README.md#installation). The compiler rules are available in the `recommended-latest` preset.

The ESLint rule will:
- Identify violations of the [Rules of React](/reference/rules)
- Show which components can't be optimized
- Provide helpful error messages for fixing issues

## Verify Your Setup {/*verify-your-setup*/}

After installation, verify that React Compiler is working correctly.

### Check React DevTools {/*check-react-devtools*/}

Components optimized by React Compiler will show a "Memo ✨" badge in React DevTools:

1. Install the [React Developer Tools](/learn/react-developer-tools) browser extension
2. Open your app in development mode
3. Open React DevTools
4. Look for the ✨ emoji next to component names

If the compiler is working:
- Components will show a "Memo ✨" badge in React DevTools
- Expensive calculations will be automatically memoized
- No manual `useMemo` is required

### Check Build Output {/*check-build-output*/}

You can also verify the compiler is running by checking your build output. The compiled code will include automatic memoization logic that the compiler adds automatically.

```js
import { c as _c } from "react/compiler-runtime";
export default function MyApp() {
  const $ = _c(1);
  let t0;
  if ($[0] === Symbol.for("react.memo_cache_sentinel")) {
    t0 = <div>Hello World</div>;
    $[0] = t0;
  } else {
    t0 = $[0];
  }
  return t0;
}

```

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### Opting out specific components {/*opting-out-specific-components*/}

If a component is causing issues after compilation, you can temporarily opt it out using the `"use no memo"` directive:

```js
function ProblematicComponent() {
  "use no memo";
  // Component code here
}
```

This tells the compiler to skip optimization for this specific component. You should fix the underlying issue and remove the directive once resolved.

For more troubleshooting help, see the [debugging guide](/learn/react-compiler/debugging).

## Next Steps {/*next-steps*/}

Now that you have React Compiler installed, learn more about:

- [React version compatibility](/reference/react-compiler/target) for React 17 and 18
- [Configuration options](/reference/react-compiler/configuration) to customize the compiler
- [Incremental adoption strategies](/learn/react-compiler/incremental-adoption) for existing codebases
- [Debugging techniques](/learn/react-compiler/debugging) for troubleshooting issues
- [Compiling Libraries guide](/reference/react-compiler/compiling-libraries) for compiling your React library

title: Incremental Adoption
---

<Intro>
React Compiler can be adopted incrementally, allowing you to try it on specific parts of your codebase first. This guide shows you how to gradually roll out the compiler in existing projects.
</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* Why incremental adoption is recommended
* Using Babel overrides for directory-based adoption
* Using the "use memo" directive for opt-in compilation
* Using the "use no memo" directive to exclude components
* Runtime feature flags with gating
* Monitoring your adoption progress

</YouWillLearn>

## Why Incremental Adoption? {/*why-incremental-adoption*/}

React Compiler is designed to optimize your entire codebase automatically, but you don't have to adopt it all at once. Incremental adoption gives you control over the rollout process, letting you test the compiler on small parts of your app before expanding to the rest.

Starting small helps you build confidence in the compiler's optimizations. You can verify that your app behaves correctly with compiled code, measure performance improvements, and identify any edge cases specific to your codebase. This approach is especially valuable for production applications where stability is critical.

Incremental adoption also makes it easier to address any Rules of React violations the compiler might find. Instead of fixing violations across your entire codebase at once, you can tackle them systematically as you expand compiler coverage. This keeps the migration manageable and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.

By controlling which parts of your code get compiled, you can also run A/B tests to measure the real-world impact of the compiler's optimizations. This data helps you make informed decisions about full adoption and demonstrates the value to your team.

## Approaches to Incremental Adoption {/*approaches-to-incremental-adoption*/}

There are three main approaches to adopt React Compiler incrementally:

1. **Babel overrides** - Apply the compiler to specific directories
2. **Opt-in with "use memo"** - Only compile components that explicitly opt in
3. **Runtime gating** - Control compilation with feature flags

All approaches allow you to test the compiler on specific parts of your application before full rollout.

## Directory-Based Adoption with Babel Overrides {/*directory-based-adoption*/}

Babel's `overrides` option lets you apply different plugins to different parts of your codebase. This is ideal for gradually adopting React Compiler directory by directory.

### Basic Configuration {/*basic-configuration*/}

Start by applying the compiler to a specific directory:

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // Global plugins that apply to all files
  ],
  overrides: [
    {
      test: './src/modern/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      plugins: [
        'babel-plugin-react-compiler'
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

### Expanding Coverage {/*expanding-coverage*/}

As you gain confidence, add more directories:

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // Global plugins
  ],
  overrides: [
    {
      test: ['./src/modern/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './src/features/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
      plugins: [
        'babel-plugin-react-compiler'
      ]
    },
    {
      test: './src/legacy/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      plugins: [
        // Different plugins for legacy code
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

### With Compiler Options {/*with-compiler-options*/}

You can also configure compiler options per override:

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [],
  overrides: [
    {
      test: './src/experimental/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      plugins: [
        ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', {
          // options ...
        }]
      ]
    },
    {
      test: './src/production/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
      plugins: [
        ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', {
          // options ...
        }]
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```


## Opt-in Mode with "use memo" {/*opt-in-mode-with-use-memo*/}

For maximum control, you can use `compilationMode: 'annotation'` to only compile components and hooks that explicitly opt in with the `"use memo"` directive.

<Note>
This approach gives you fine-grained control over individual components and hooks. It's useful when you want to test the compiler on specific components without affecting entire directories.
</Note>

### Annotation Mode Configuration {/*annotation-mode-configuration*/}

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', {
      compilationMode: 'annotation',
    }],
  ],
};
```

### Using the Directive {/*using-the-directive*/}

Add `"use memo"` at the beginning of functions you want to compile:

```js
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  "use memo"; // Opt this component into compilation

  const sortedTodos = todos.slice().sort();

  return (
    <ul>
      {sortedTodos.map(todo => (
        <TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function useSortedData(data) {
  "use memo"; // Opt this hook into compilation

  return data.slice().sort();
}
```

With `compilationMode: 'annotation'`, you must:
- Add `"use memo"` to every component you want optimized
- Add `"use memo"` to every custom hook
- Remember to add it to new components

This gives you precise control over which components are compiled while you evaluate the compiler's impact.

## Runtime Feature Flags with Gating {/*runtime-feature-flags-with-gating*/}

The `gating` option enables you to control compilation at runtime using feature flags. This is useful for running A/B tests or gradually rolling out the compiler based on user segments.

### How Gating Works {/*how-gating-works*/}

The compiler wraps optimized code in a runtime check. If the gate returns `true`, the optimized version runs. Otherwise, the original code runs.

### Gating Configuration {/*gating-configuration*/}

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', {
      gating: {
        source: 'ReactCompilerFeatureFlags',
        importSpecifierName: 'isCompilerEnabled',
      },
    }],
  ],
};
```

### Implementing the Feature Flag {/*implementing-the-feature-flag*/}

Create a module that exports your gating function:

```js
// ReactCompilerFeatureFlags.js
export function isCompilerEnabled() {
  // Use your feature flag system
  return getFeatureFlag('react-compiler-enabled');
}
```

## Troubleshooting Adoption {/*troubleshooting-adoption*/}

If you encounter issues during adoption:

1. Use `"use no memo"` to temporarily exclude problematic components
2. Check the [debugging guide](/learn/react-compiler/debugging) for common issues
3. Fix Rules of React violations identified by the ESLint plugin
4. Consider using `compilationMode: 'annotation'` for more gradual adoption

## Next Steps {/*next-steps*/}

- Read the [configuration guide](/reference/react-compiler/configuration) for more options
- Learn about [debugging techniques](/learn/react-compiler/debugging)
- Check the [API reference](/reference/react-compiler/configuration) for all compiler options

title: Debugging and Troubleshooting
---

<Intro>
This guide helps you identify and fix issues when using React Compiler. Learn how to debug compilation problems and resolve common issues.
</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* The difference between compiler errors and runtime issues
* Common patterns that break compilation
* Step-by-step debugging workflow

</YouWillLearn>

## Understanding Compiler Behavior {/*understanding-compiler-behavior*/}

React Compiler is designed to handle code that follows the [Rules of React](/reference/rules). When it encounters code that might break these rules, it safely skips optimization rather than risk changing your app's behavior.

### Compiler Errors vs Runtime Issues {/*compiler-errors-vs-runtime-issues*/}

**Compiler errors** occur at build time and prevent your code from compiling. These are rare because the compiler is designed to skip problematic code rather than fail.

**Runtime issues** occur when compiled code behaves differently than expected. Most of the time, if you encounter an issue with React Compiler, it's a runtime issue. This typically happens when your code violates the Rules of React in subtle ways that the compiler couldn't detect, and the compiler mistakenly compiled a component it should have skipped.

When debugging runtime issues, focus your efforts on finding Rules of React violations in the affected components that were not detected by the ESLint rule. The compiler relies on your code following these rules, and when they're broken in ways it can't detect, that's when runtime problems occur.


## Common Breaking Patterns {/*common-breaking-patterns*/}

One of the main ways React Compiler can break your app is if your code was written to rely on memoization for correctness. This means your app depends on specific values being memoized to work properly. Since the compiler may memoize differently than your manual approach, this can lead to unexpected behavior like effects over-firing, infinite loops, or missing updates.

Common scenarios where this occurs:

- **Effects that rely on referential equality** - When effects depend on objects or arrays maintaining the same reference across renders
- **Dependency arrays that need stable references** - When unstable dependencies cause effects to fire too often or create infinite loops
- **Conditional logic based on reference checks** - When code uses referential equality checks for caching or optimization

## Debugging Workflow {/*debugging-workflow*/}

Follow these steps when you encounter issues:

### Compiler Build Errors {/*compiler-build-errors*/}

If you encounter a compiler error that unexpectedly breaks your build, this is likely a bug in the compiler. Report it to the [facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues) repository with:
- The error message
- The code that caused the error
- Your React and compiler versions

### Runtime Issues {/*runtime-issues*/}

For runtime behavior issues:

### 1. Temporarily Disable Compilation {/*temporarily-disable-compilation*/}

Use `"use no memo"` to isolate whether an issue is compiler-related:

```js
function ProblematicComponent() {
  "use no memo"; // Skip compilation for this component
  // ... rest of component
}
```

If the issue disappears, it's likely related to a Rules of React violation.

You can also try removing manual memoization (useMemo, useCallback, memo) from the problematic component to verify that your app works correctly without any memoization. If the bug still occurs when all memoization is removed, you have a Rules of React violation that needs to be fixed.

### 2. Fix Issues Step by Step {/*fix-issues-step-by-step*/}

1. Identify the root cause (often memoization-for-correctness)
2. Test after each fix
3. Remove `"use no memo"` once fixed
4. Verify the component shows the ✨ badge in React DevTools

## Reporting Compiler Bugs {/*reporting-compiler-bugs*/}

If you believe you've found a compiler bug:

1. **Verify it's not a Rules of React violation** - Check with ESLint
2. **Create a minimal reproduction** - Isolate the issue in a small example
3. **Test without the compiler** - Confirm the issue only occurs with compilation
4. **File an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/new?template=compiler_bug_report.yml)**:
   - React and compiler versions
   - Minimal reproduction code
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Any error messages

## Next Steps {/*next-steps*/}

- Review the [Rules of React](/reference/rules) to prevent issues
- Check the [incremental adoption guide](/learn/react-compiler/incremental-adoption) for gradual rollout strategies

title: Keeping Components Pure
---

<Intro>

Some JavaScript functions are *pure.* Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more. By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. To get these benefits, though, there are a few rules you must follow.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* What purity is and how it helps you avoid bugs
* How to keep components pure by keeping changes out of the render phase
* How to use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components

</YouWillLearn>

## Purity: Components as formulas {/*purity-components-as-formulas*/}

In computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), [a pure function](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) is a function with the following characteristics:

* **It minds its own business.** It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
* **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.

You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas in math.

Consider this math formula: <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math>.

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 2</Math> then <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 4</Math>. Always. 

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math> then <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 6</Math>. Always. 

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math>, <MathI>y</MathI> won't sometimes be <Math>9</Math> or <Math>–1</Math> or <Math>2.5</Math> depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market. 

If <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> and <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math>, <MathI>y</MathI> will _always_ be <Math>6</Math>. 

If we made this into a JavaScript function, it would look like this:

```js
function double(number) {
  return 2 * number;
}
```

In the above example, `double` is a **pure function.** If you pass it `3`, it will return `6`. Always.

React is designed around this concept. **React assumes that every component you write is a pure function.** This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
function Recipe({ drinkers }) {
  return (
    <ol>    
      <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li>
      <li>Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.</li>
      <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Spiced Chai Recipe</h1>
      <h2>For two</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={2} />
      <h2>For a gathering</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={4} />
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

When you pass `drinkers={2}` to `Recipe`, it will return JSX containing `2 cups of water`. Always. 

If you pass `drinkers={4}`, it will return JSX containing `4 cups of water`. Always.

Just like a math formula. 

You could think of your components as recipes: if you follow them and don't introduce new ingredients during the cooking process, you will get the same dish every time. That "dish" is the JSX that the component serves to React to [render.](/learn/render-and-commit)

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_puritea-recipe.png" alt="A tea recipe for x people: take x cups of water, add x spoons of tea and 0.5x spoons of spices, and 0.5x cups of milk" />

## Side Effects: (un)intended consequences {/*side-effects-unintended-consequences*/}

React's rendering process must always be pure. Components should only *return* their JSX, and not *change* any objects or variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure!

Here is a component that breaks this rule:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [5]}}
let guest = 0;

function Cup() {
  // Bad: changing a preexisting variable!
  guest = guest + 1;
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

This component is reading and writing a `guest` variable declared outside of it. This means that **calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX!** And what's more, if _other_ components read `guest`, they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered! That's not predictable.

Going back to our formula <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math>, now even if <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 2</Math>, we cannot trust that <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 4</Math>. Our tests could fail, our users would be baffled, planes would fall out of the sky—you can see how this would lead to confusing bugs!

You can fix this component by [passing `guest` as a prop instead](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component):

<Sandpack>

```js
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup guest={1} />
      <Cup guest={2} />
      <Cup guest={3} />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Now your component is pure, as the JSX it returns only depends on the `guest` prop.

In general, you should not expect your components to be rendered in any particular order. It doesn't matter if you call <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> before or after <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 5<MathI>x</MathI></Math>: both formulas will resolve independently of each other. In the same way, each component should only "think for itself", and not attempt to coordinate with or depend upon others during rendering. Rendering is like a school exam: each component should calculate JSX on their own!

<DeepDive>

#### Detecting impure calculations with StrictMode {/*detecting-impure-calculations-with-strict-mode*/}

Although you might not have used them all yet, in React there are three kinds of inputs that you can read while rendering: [props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component), [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), and [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) You should always treat these inputs as read-only.

When you want to *change* something in response to user input, you should [set state](/learn/state-a-components-memory) instead of writing to a variable. You should never change preexisting variables or objects while your component is rendering.

React offers a "Strict Mode" in which it calls each component's function twice during development. **By calling the component functions twice, Strict Mode helps find components that break these rules.**

Notice how the original example displayed "Guest #2", "Guest #4", and "Guest #6" instead of "Guest #1", "Guest #2", and "Guest #3". The original function was impure, so calling it twice broke it. But the fixed pure version works even if the function is called twice every time. **Pure functions only calculate, so calling them twice won't change anything**--just like calling `double(2)` twice doesn't change what's returned, and solving <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> twice doesn't change what <MathI>y</MathI> is. Same inputs, same outputs. Always.

Strict Mode has no effect in production, so it won't slow down the app for your users. To opt into Strict Mode, you can wrap your root component into `<React.StrictMode>`. Some frameworks do this by default.

</DeepDive>

### Local mutation: Your component's little secret {/*local-mutation-your-components-little-secret*/}

In the above example, the problem was that the component changed a *preexisting* variable while rendering. This is often called a **"mutation"** to make it sound a bit scarier. Pure functions don't mutate variables outside of the function's scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure!

However, **it's completely fine to change variables and objects that you've *just* created while rendering.** In this example, you create an `[]` array, assign it to a `cups` variable, and then `push` a dozen cups into it:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaGathering() {
  const cups = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
    cups.push(<Cup key={i} guest={i} />);
  }
  return cups;
}
```

</Sandpack>

If the `cups` variable or the `[]` array were created outside the `TeaGathering` function, this would be a huge problem! You would be changing a *preexisting* object by pushing items into that array.

However, it's fine because you've created them *during the same render*, inside `TeaGathering`. No code outside of `TeaGathering` will ever know that this happened. This is called **"local mutation"**—it's like your component's little secret.

## Where you _can_ cause side effects {/*where-you-_can_-cause-side-effects*/}

While functional programming relies heavily on purity, at some point, somewhere, _something_ has to change. That's kind of the point of programming! These changes—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—are called **side effects.** They're things that happen _"on the side"_, not during rendering.

In React, **side effects usually belong inside [event handlers.](/learn/responding-to-events)** Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined *inside* your component, they don't run *during* rendering! **So event handlers don't need to be pure.**

If you've exhausted all other options and can't find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. **However, this approach should be your last resort.**

When possible, try to express your logic with rendering alone. You'll be surprised how far this can take you!

<DeepDive>

#### Why does React care about purity? {/*why-does-react-care-about-purity*/}

Writing pure functions takes some habit and discipline. But it also unlocks marvelous opportunities:

* Your components could run in a different environment—for example, on the server! Since they return the same result for the same inputs, one component can serve many user requests.
* You can improve performance by [skipping rendering](/reference/react/memo) components whose inputs have not changed. This is safe because pure functions always return the same results, so they are safe to cache.
* If some data changes in the middle of rendering a deep component tree, React can restart rendering without wasting time to finish the outdated render. Purity makes it safe to stop calculating at any time.

Every new React feature we're building takes advantage of purity. From data fetching to animations to performance, keeping components pure unlocks the power of the React paradigm.

</DeepDive>

<Recap>

* A component must be pure, meaning:
  * **It minds its own business.** It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering.
  * **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. 
* Rendering can happen at any time, so components should not depend on each others' rendering sequence.
* You should not mutate any of the inputs that your components use for rendering. That includes props, state, and context. To update the screen, ["set" state](/learn/state-a-components-memory) instead of mutating preexisting objects.
* Strive to express your component's logic in the JSX you return. When you need to "change things", you'll usually want to do it in an event handler. As a last resort, you can `useEffect`.
* Writing pure functions takes a bit of practice, but it unlocks the power of React's paradigm.

#### Fix a broken clock {/*fix-a-broken-clock*/}

This component tries to set the `<h1>`'s CSS class to `"night"` during the time from midnight to six hours in the morning, and `"day"` at all other times. However, it doesn't work. Can you fix this component?

You can verify whether your solution works by temporarily changing the computer's timezone. When the current time is between midnight and six in the morning, the clock should have inverted colors!

<Hint>

Rendering is a *calculation*, it shouldn't try to "do" things. Can you express the same idea differently?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/Clock.js active
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  const hours = time.getHours();
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    document.getElementById('time').className = 'night';
  } else {
    document.getElementById('time').className = 'day';
  }
  return (
    <h1 id="time">
      {time.toLocaleTimeString()}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock.js';

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}

export default function App() {
  const time = useTime();
  return (
    <Clock time={time} />
  );
}
```

```css
body > * {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
.day {
  background: #fff;
  color: #222;
}
.night {
  background: #222;
  color: #fff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can fix this component by calculating the `className` and including it in the render output:

<Sandpack>

```js src/Clock.js active
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  const hours = time.getHours();
  let className;
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    className = 'night';
  } else {
    className = 'day';
  }
  return (
    <h1 className={className}>
      {time.toLocaleTimeString()}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock.js';

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}

export default function App() {
  const time = useTime();
  return (
    <Clock time={time} />
  );
}
```

```css
body > * {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
.day {
  background: #fff;
  color: #222;
}
.night {
  background: #222;
  color: #fff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In this example, the side effect (modifying the DOM) was not necessary at all. You only needed to return JSX.

</Solution>

#### Fix a broken profile {/*fix-a-broken-profile*/}

Two `Profile` components are rendered side by side with different data. Press "Collapse" on the first profile, and then "Expand" it. You'll notice that both profiles now show the same person. This is a bug.

Find the cause of the bug and fix it.

<Hint>

The buggy code is in `Profile.js`. Make sure you read it all from top to bottom!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7]}} src/Profile.js
import Panel from './Panel.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

let currentPerson;

export default function Profile({ person }) {
  currentPerson = person;
  return (
    <Panel>
      <Header />
      <Avatar />
    </Panel>
  )
}

function Header() {
  return <h1>{currentPerson.name}</h1>;
}

function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(currentPerson)}
      alt={currentPerson.name}
      width={50}
      height={50}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/Panel.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Panel({ children }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
        {open ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
      </button>
      {open && children}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'lrWQx8l',
        name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
      }} />
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'MK3eW3A',
        name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
      }} />
    </>
  )
}
```

```js src/utils.js hidden
export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 5px; border-radius: 50%; }
.panel {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}
h1 { margin: 5px; font-size: 18px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The problem is that the `Profile` component writes to a preexisting variable called `currentPerson`, and the `Header` and `Avatar` components read from it. This makes *all three of them* impure and difficult to predict.

To fix the bug, remove the `currentPerson` variable. Instead, pass all information from `Profile` to `Header` and `Avatar` via props. You'll need to add a `person` prop to both components and pass it all the way down.

<Sandpack>

```js src/Profile.js active
import Panel from './Panel.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function Profile({ person }) {
  return (
    <Panel>
      <Header person={person} />
      <Avatar person={person} />
    </Panel>
  )
}

function Header({ person }) {
  return <h1>{person.name}</h1>;
}

function Avatar({ person }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={50}
      height={50}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/Panel.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Panel({ children }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
        {open ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
      </button>
      {open && children}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'lrWQx8l',
        name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
      }} />
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'MK3eW3A',
        name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js hidden
export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 5px; border-radius: 50%; }
.panel {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}
h1 { margin: 5px; font-size: 18px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Remember that React does not guarantee that component functions will execute in any particular order, so you can't communicate between them by setting variables. All communication must happen through props.

</Solution>

#### Fix a broken story tray {/*fix-a-broken-story-tray*/}

The CEO of your company is asking you to add "stories" to your online clock app, and you can't say no. You've written a `StoryTray` component that accepts a list of `stories`, followed by a "Create Story" placeholder.

You implemented the "Create Story" placeholder by pushing one more fake story at the end of the `stories` array that you receive as a prop. But for some reason, "Create Story" appears more than once. Fix the issue.

<Sandpack>

```js src/StoryTray.js active
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  stories.push({
    id: 'create',
    label: 'Create Story'
  });

  return (
    <ul>
      {stories.map(story => (
        <li key={story.id}>
          {story.label}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}} src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StoryTray from './StoryTray.js';

const initialStories = [
  {id: 0, label: "Ankit's Story" },
  {id: 1, label: "Taylor's Story" },
];

export default function App() {
  const [stories, setStories] = useState([...initialStories])
  const time = useTime();

  // HACK: Prevent the memory from growing forever while you read docs.
  // We're breaking our own rules here.
  if (stories.length > 100) {
    stories.length = 100;
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()} now.</h2>
      <StoryTray stories={stories} />
    </div>
  );
}

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

```css
ul {
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

```js sandbox.config.json hidden
{
  "hardReloadOnChange": true
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Notice how whenever the clock updates, "Create Story" is added *twice*. This serves as a hint that we have a mutation during rendering--Strict Mode calls components twice to make these issues more noticeable.

`StoryTray` function is not pure. By calling `push` on the received `stories` array (a prop!), it is mutating an object that was created *before* `StoryTray` started rendering. This makes it buggy and very difficult to predict.

The simplest fix is to not touch the array at all, and render "Create Story" separately:

<Sandpack>

```js src/StoryTray.js active
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {stories.map(story => (
        <li key={story.id}>
          {story.label}
        </li>
      ))}
      <li>Create Story</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}} src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StoryTray from './StoryTray.js';

const initialStories = [
  {id: 0, label: "Ankit's Story" },
  {id: 1, label: "Taylor's Story" },
];

export default function App() {
  const [stories, setStories] = useState([...initialStories])
  const time = useTime();

  // HACK: Prevent the memory from growing forever while you read docs.
  // We're breaking our own rules here.
  if (stories.length > 100) {
    stories.length = 100;
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()} now.</h2>
      <StoryTray stories={stories} />
    </div>
  );
}

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

```css
ul {
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Alternatively, you could create a _new_ array (by copying the existing one) before you push an item into it:

<Sandpack>

```js src/StoryTray.js active
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  // Copy the array!
  const storiesToDisplay = stories.slice();

  // Does not affect the original array:
  storiesToDisplay.push({
    id: 'create',
    label: 'Create Story'
  });

  return (
    <ul>
      {storiesToDisplay.map(story => (
        <li key={story.id}>
          {story.label}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}} src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StoryTray from './StoryTray.js';

const initialStories = [
  {id: 0, label: "Ankit's Story" },
  {id: 1, label: "Taylor's Story" },
];

export default function App() {
  const [stories, setStories] = useState([...initialStories])
  const time = useTime();

  // HACK: Prevent the memory from growing forever while you read docs.
  // We're breaking our own rules here.
  if (stories.length > 100) {
    stories.length = 100;
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()} now.</h2>
      <StoryTray stories={stories} />
    </div>
  );
}

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

```css
ul {
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

This keeps your mutation local and your rendering function pure. However, you still need to be careful: for example, if you tried to change any of the array's existing items, you'd have to clone those items too.

It is useful to remember which operations on arrays mutate them, and which don't. For example, `push`, `pop`, `reverse`, and `sort` will mutate the original array, but `slice`, `filter`, and `map` will create a new one.

title: 'Manipulating the DOM with Refs'
---

<Intro>

React automatically updates the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) to match your render output, so your components won't often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React--for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a *ref* to the DOM node.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

- How to access a DOM node managed by React with the `ref` attribute
- How the `ref` JSX attribute relates to the `useRef` Hook
- How to access another component's DOM node
- In which cases it's safe to modify the DOM managed by React

</YouWillLearn>

## Getting a ref to the node {/*getting-a-ref-to-the-node*/}

To access a DOM node managed by React, first, import the `useRef` Hook:

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';
```

Then, use it to declare a ref inside your component:

```js
const myRef = useRef(null);
```

Finally, pass your ref as the `ref` attribute to the JSX tag for which you want to get the DOM node:

```js
<div ref={myRef}>
```

The `useRef` Hook returns an object with a single property called `current`. Initially, `myRef.current` will be `null`. When React creates a DOM node for this `<div>`, React will put a reference to this node into `myRef.current`. You can then access this DOM node from your [event handlers](/learn/responding-to-events) and use the built-in [browser APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element) defined on it.

```js
// You can use any browser APIs, for example:
myRef.current.scrollIntoView();
```

### Example: Focusing a text input {/*example-focusing-a-text-input*/}

In this example, clicking the button will focus the input:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Focus the input
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

To implement this:

1. Declare `inputRef` with the `useRef` Hook.
2. Pass it as `<input ref={inputRef}>`. This tells React to **put this `<input>`'s DOM node into `inputRef.current`.**
3. In the `handleClick` function, read the input DOM node from `inputRef.current` and call [`focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) on it with `inputRef.current.focus()`.
4. Pass the `handleClick` event handler to `<button>` with `onClick`.

While DOM manipulation is the most common use case for refs, the `useRef` Hook can be used for storing other things outside React, like timer IDs. Similarly to state, refs remain between renders. Refs are like state variables that don't trigger re-renders when you set them. Read about refs in [Referencing Values with Refs.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)

### Example: Scrolling to an element {/*example-scrolling-to-an-element*/}

You can have more than a single ref in a component. In this example, there is a carousel of three images. Each button centers an image by calling the browser [`scrollIntoView()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) method on the corresponding DOM node:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function CatFriends() {
  const firstCatRef = useRef(null);
  const secondCatRef = useRef(null);
  const thirdCatRef = useRef(null);

  function handleScrollToFirstCat() {
    firstCatRef.current.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth',
      block: 'nearest',
      inline: 'center'
    });
  }

  function handleScrollToSecondCat() {
    secondCatRef.current.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth',
      block: 'nearest',
      inline: 'center'
    });
  }

  function handleScrollToThirdCat() {
    thirdCatRef.current.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth',
      block: 'nearest',
      inline: 'center'
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={handleScrollToFirstCat}>
          Neo
        </button>
        <button onClick={handleScrollToSecondCat}>
          Millie
        </button>
        <button onClick={handleScrollToThirdCat}>
          Bella
        </button>
      </nav>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img
              src="https://placecats.com/neo/300/200"
              alt="Neo"
              ref={firstCatRef}
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="https://placecats.com/millie/200/200"
              alt="Millie"
              ref={secondCatRef}
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="https://placecats.com/bella/199/200"
              alt="Bella"
              ref={thirdCatRef}
            />
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

nav {
  text-align: center;
}

button {
  margin: .25rem;
}

ul,

  list-style: none;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

li {
  display: inline;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

#### How to manage a list of refs using a ref callback {/*how-to-manage-a-list-of-refs-using-a-ref-callback*/}

In the above examples, there is a predefined number of refs. However, sometimes you might need a ref to each item in the list, and you don't know how many you will have. Something like this **wouldn't work**:

```js
<ul>
  {items.map((item) => {
    // Doesn't work!
    const ref = useRef(null);
    return <li ref={ref} />;
  })}
</ul>
```

This is because **Hooks must only be called at the top-level of your component.** You can't call `useRef` in a loop, in a condition, or inside a `map()` call.

One possible way around this is to get a single ref to their parent element, and then use DOM manipulation methods like [`querySelectorAll`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) to "find" the individual child nodes from it. However, this is brittle and can break if your DOM structure changes.

Another solution is to **pass a function to the `ref` attribute.** This is called a [`ref` callback.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#ref-callback) React will call your ref callback with the DOM node when it's time to set the ref, and call the cleanup function returned from the callback when it's time to clear it. This lets you maintain your own array or a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), and access any ref by its index or some kind of ID.

This example shows how you can use this approach to scroll to an arbitrary node in a long list:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef, useState } from "react";

export default function CatFriends() {
  const itemsRef = useRef(null);
  const [catList, setCatList] = useState(setupCatList);

  function scrollToCat(cat) {
    const map = getMap();
    const node = map.get(cat);
    node.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: "smooth",
      block: "nearest",
      inline: "center",
    });
  }

  function getMap() {
    if (!itemsRef.current) {
      // Initialize the Map on first usage.
      itemsRef.current = new Map();
    }
    return itemsRef.current;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => scrollToCat(catList[0])}>Neo</button>
        <button onClick={() => scrollToCat(catList[5])}>Millie</button>
        <button onClick={() => scrollToCat(catList[8])}>Bella</button>
      </nav>
      <div>
        <ul>
          {catList.map((cat) => (
            <li
              key={cat.id}
              ref={(node) => {
                const map = getMap();
                map.set(cat, node);

                return () => {
                  map.delete(cat);
                };
              }}
            >
              <img src={cat.imageUrl} />
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

function setupCatList() {
  const catCount = 10;
  const catList = new Array(catCount)
  for (let i = 0; i < catCount; i++) {
    let imageUrl = '';
    if (i < 5) {
      imageUrl = "https://placecats.com/neo/320/240";
    } else if (i < 8) {
      imageUrl = "https://placecats.com/millie/320/240";
    } else {
      imageUrl = "https://placecats.com/bella/320/240";
    }
    catList[i] = {
      id: i,
      imageUrl,
    };
  }
  return catList;
}

```

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

nav {
  text-align: center;
}

button {
  margin: .25rem;
}

ul,
li {
  list-style: none;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

li {
  display: inline;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In this example, `itemsRef` doesn't hold a single DOM node. Instead, it holds a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) from item ID to a DOM node. ([Refs can hold any values!](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)) The [`ref` callback](/reference/react-dom/components/common#ref-callback) on every list item takes care to update the Map:

```js
<li
  key={cat.id}
  ref={node => {
    const map = getMap();
    // Add to the Map
    map.set(cat, node);

    return () => {
      // Remove from the Map
      map.delete(cat);
    };
  }}
>
```

This lets you read individual DOM nodes from the Map later.

<Note>

When Strict Mode is enabled, ref callbacks will run twice in development.

## Accessing another component's DOM nodes {/*accessing-another-components-dom-nodes*/}

<Pitfall>
Refs are an escape hatch. Manually manipulating _another_ component's DOM nodes can make your code fragile.
</Pitfall>

You can pass refs from parent component to child components [just like any other prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component).

```js {3-4,9}
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyInput({ ref }) {
  return <input ref={ref} />;
}

function MyForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  return <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
}
```

In the above example, a ref is created in the parent component, `MyForm`, and is passed to the child component, `MyInput`. `MyInput` then passes the ref to `<input>`. Because `<input>` is a [built-in component](/reference/react-dom/components/common) React sets the `.current` property of the ref to the `<input>` DOM element.

The `inputRef` created in `MyForm` now points to the `<input>` DOM element returned by `MyInput`. A click handler created in `MyForm` can access `inputRef` and call `focus()` to set the focus on `<input>`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyInput({ ref }) {
  return <input ref={ref} />;
}

export default function MyForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Focus the input
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<DeepDive>

#### Exposing a subset of the API with an imperative handle {/*exposing-a-subset-of-the-api-with-an-imperative-handle*/}

In the above example, the ref passed to `MyInput` is passed on to the original DOM input element. This lets the parent component call `focus()` on it. However, this also lets the parent component do something else--for example, change its CSS styles. In uncommon cases, you may want to restrict the exposed functionality. You can do that with [`useImperativeHandle`](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle):

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from "react";

function MyInput({ ref }) {
  const realInputRef = useRef(null);
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    // Only expose focus and nothing else
    focus() {
      realInputRef.current.focus();
    },
  }));
  return <input ref={realInputRef} />;
};

export default function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Here, `realInputRef` inside `MyInput` holds the actual input DOM node. However, [`useImperativeHandle`](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle) instructs React to provide your own special object as the value of a ref to the parent component. So `inputRef.current` inside the `Form` component will only have the `focus` method. In this case, the ref "handle" is not the DOM node, but the custom object you create inside [`useImperativeHandle`](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle) call.

</DeepDive>

## When React attaches the refs {/*when-react-attaches-the-refs*/}

In React, every update is split in [two phases](/learn/render-and-commit#step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom):

* During **render,** React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen.
* During **commit,** React applies changes to the DOM.

In general, you [don't want](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs#best-practices-for-refs) to access refs during rendering. That goes for refs holding DOM nodes as well. During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so `ref.current` will be `null`. And during the rendering of updates, the DOM nodes haven't been updated yet. So it's too early to read them.

React sets `ref.current` during the commit. Before updating the DOM, React sets the affected `ref.current` values to `null`. After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.

**Usually, you will access refs from event handlers.** If you want to do something with a ref, but there is no particular event to do it in, you might need an Effect. We will discuss Effects on the next pages.

<DeepDive>

#### Flushing state updates synchronously with flushSync {/*flushing-state-updates-synchronously-with-flush-sync*/}

Consider code like this, which adds a new todo and scrolls the screen down to the last child of the list. Notice how, for some reason, it always scrolls to the todo that was *just before* the last added one:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

export default function TodoList() {
  const listRef = useRef(null);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAdd() {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text: text };
    setText('');
    setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
    listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth',
      block: 'nearest'
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>
        Add
      </button>
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <ul ref={listRef}>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 0;
let initialTodos = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  initialTodos.push({
    id: nextId++,
    text: 'Todo #' + (i + 1)
  });
}
```

</Sandpack>

The issue is with these two lines:

```js
setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView();
```

In React, [state updates are queued.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) Usually, this is what you want. However, here it causes a problem because `setTodos` does not immediately update the DOM. So the time you scroll the list to its last element, the todo has not yet been added. This is why scrolling always "lags behind" by one item.

To fix this issue, you can force React to update ("flush") the DOM synchronously. To do this, import `flushSync` from `react-dom` and **wrap the state update** into a `flushSync` call:

```js
flushSync(() => {
  setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
});
listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView();
```

This will instruct React to update the DOM synchronously right after the code wrapped in `flushSync` executes. As a result, the last todo will already be in the DOM by the time you try to scroll to it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

export default function TodoList() {
  const listRef = useRef(null);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAdd() {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text: text };
    flushSync(() => {
      setText('');
      setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
    });
    listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth',
      block: 'nearest'
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>
        Add
      </button>
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <ul ref={listRef}>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 0;
let initialTodos = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  initialTodos.push({
    id: nextId++,
    text: 'Todo #' + (i + 1)
  });
}
```

## Best practices for DOM manipulation with refs {/*best-practices-for-dom-manipulation-with-refs*/}

Refs are an escape hatch. You should only use them when you have to "step outside React". Common examples of this include managing focus, scroll position, or calling browser APIs that React does not expose.

If you stick to non-destructive actions like focusing and scrolling, you shouldn't encounter any problems. However, if you try to **modify** the DOM manually, you can risk conflicting with the changes React is making.

To illustrate this problem, this example includes a welcome message and two buttons. The first button toggles its presence using [conditional rendering](/learn/conditional-rendering) and [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), as you would usually do in React. The second button uses the [`remove()` DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/remove) to forcefully remove it from the DOM outside of React's control.

Try pressing "Toggle with setState" a few times. The message should disappear and appear again. Then press "Remove from the DOM". This will forcefully remove it. Finally, press "Toggle with setState":

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);
  const ref = useRef(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setShow(!show);
        }}>
        Toggle with setState
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          ref.current.remove();
        }}>
        Remove from the DOM
      </button>
      {show && <p ref={ref}>Hello world</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
p,
button {
  display: block;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

After you've manually removed the DOM element, trying to use `setState` to show it again will lead to a crash. This is because you've changed the DOM, and React doesn't know how to continue managing it correctly.

**Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React.** Modifying, adding children to, or removing children from elements that are managed by React can lead to inconsistent visual results or crashes like above.

However, this doesn't mean that you can't do it at all. It requires caution. **You can safely modify parts of the DOM that React has _no reason_ to update.** For example, if some `<div>` is always empty in the JSX, React won't have a reason to touch its children list. Therefore, it is safe to manually add or remove elements there.

<Recap>

- Refs are a generic concept, but most often you'll use them to hold DOM elements.
- You instruct React to put a DOM node into `myRef.current` by passing `<div ref={myRef}>`.
- Usually, you will use refs for non-destructive actions like focusing, scrolling, or measuring DOM elements.
- A component doesn't expose its DOM nodes by default. You can opt into exposing a DOM node by using the `ref` prop.
- Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React.
- If you do modify DOM nodes managed by React, modify parts that React has no reason to update.

#### Play and pause the video {/*play-and-pause-the-video*/}

In this example, the button toggles a state variable to switch between a playing and a paused state. However, in order to actually play or pause the video, toggling state is not enough. You also need to call [`play()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play) and [`pause()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/pause) on the DOM element for the `<video>`. Add a ref to it, and make the button work.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);

  function handleClick() {
    const nextIsPlaying = !isPlaying;
    setIsPlaying(nextIsPlaying);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <video width="250">
        <source
          src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
      </video>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

For an extra challenge, keep the "Play" button in sync with whether the video is playing even if the user right-clicks the video and plays it using the built-in browser media controls. You might want to listen to `onPlay` and `onPause` on the video to do that.

<Solution>

Declare a ref and put it on the `<video>` element. Then call `ref.current.play()` and `ref.current.pause()` in the event handler depending on the next state.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

export default function VideoPlayer() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const ref = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    const nextIsPlaying = !isPlaying;
    setIsPlaying(nextIsPlaying);

    if (nextIsPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <video
        width="250"
        ref={ref}
        onPlay={() => setIsPlaying(true)}
        onPause={() => setIsPlaying(false)}
      >
        <source
          src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
      </video>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In order to handle the built-in browser controls, you can add `onPlay` and `onPause` handlers to the `<video>` element and call `setIsPlaying` from them. This way, if the user plays the video using the browser controls, the state will adjust accordingly.

</Solution>

#### Focus the search field {/*focus-the-search-field*/}

Make it so that clicking the "Search" button puts focus into the field.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <button>Search</button>
      </nav>
      <input
        placeholder="Looking for something?"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Add a ref to the input, and call `focus()` on the DOM node to focus it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => {
          inputRef.current.focus();
        }}>
          Search
        </button>
      </nav>
      <input
        ref={inputRef}
        placeholder="Looking for something?"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Scrolling an image carousel {/*scrolling-an-image-carousel*/}

This image carousel has a "Next" button that switches the active image. Make the gallery scroll horizontally to the active image on click. You will want to call [`scrollIntoView()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) on the DOM node of the active image:

```js
node.scrollIntoView({
  behavior: 'smooth',
  block: 'nearest',
  inline: 'center'
});
```

<Hint>

You don't need to have a ref to every image for this exercise. It should be enough to have a ref to the currently active image, or to the list itself. Use `flushSync` to ensure the DOM is updated *before* you scroll.

</Hint>

          if (index < catList.length - 1) {
            setIndex(index + 1);
          } else {
            setIndex(0);
          }

          {catList.map((cat, i) => (
            <li key={cat.id}>
              <img
                className={
                  index === i ?
                    'active' :
                    ''
                }

      break;
    }
  }
  catList[i] = {
    id: i,
    imageUrl,
  };

ul,

li {
  display: inline;
  padding: 0.5rem;

img {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: -10px;
  transition: background 0.2s linear;
}

.active {
  background: rgba(0, 100, 150, 0.4);
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can declare a `selectedRef`, and then pass it conditionally only to the current image:

```js
<li ref={index === i ? selectedRef : null}>
```

When `index === i`, meaning that the image is the selected one, the `<li>` will receive the `selectedRef`. React will make sure that `selectedRef.current` always points at the correct DOM node.

Note that the `flushSync` call is necessary to force React to update the DOM before the scroll. Otherwise, `selectedRef.current` would always point at the previously selected item.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

export default function CatFriends() {
  const selectedRef = useRef(null);
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => {
          flushSync(() => {
            if (index < catList.length - 1) {
              setIndex(index + 1);
            } else {
              setIndex(0);
            }
          });
          selectedRef.current.scrollIntoView({
            behavior: 'smooth',
            block: 'nearest',
            inline: 'center'
          });
        }}>
          Next
        </button>
      </nav>
      <div>
        <ul>
          {catList.map((cat, i) => (
            <li
              key={cat.id}
              ref={index === i ?
                selectedRef :
                null
              }
            >
              <img

                }

#### Focus the search field with separate components {/*focus-the-search-field-with-separate-components*/}

Make it so that clicking the "Search" button puts focus into the field. Note that each component is defined in a separate file and shouldn't be moved out of it. How do you connect them together?

<Hint>

You'll need to pass `ref` as a prop to opt into exposing a DOM node from your own component like `SearchInput`.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import SearchButton from './SearchButton.js';
import SearchInput from './SearchInput.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <SearchButton />
      </nav>
      <SearchInput />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/SearchButton.js
export default function SearchButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      Search
    </button>
  );
}
```

```js src/SearchInput.js
export default function SearchInput() {
  return (
    <input
      placeholder="Looking for something?"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You'll need to add an `onClick` prop to the `SearchButton`, and make the `SearchButton` pass it down to the browser `<button>`. You'll also pass a ref down to `<SearchInput>`, which will forward it to the real `<input>` and populate it. Finally, in the click handler, you'll call `focus` on the DOM node stored inside that ref.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useRef } from 'react';
import SearchButton from './SearchButton.js';
import SearchInput from './SearchInput.js';

export default function Page() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <SearchButton onClick={() => {
          inputRef.current.focus();
        }} />
      </nav>
      <SearchInput ref={inputRef} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/SearchButton.js
export default function SearchButton({ onClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      Search
    </button>
  );
}
```

```js src/SearchInput.js
export default function SearchInput({ ref }) {
  return (
    <input
      ref={ref}
      placeholder="Looking for something?"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 10px; }
```

title: 'Synchronizing with Effects'
---

<Intro>

Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. *Effects* let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

- What Effects are
- How Effects are different from events
- How to declare an Effect in your component
- How to skip re-running an Effect unnecessarily
- Why Effects run twice in development and how to fix them

</YouWillLearn>

## What are Effects and how are they different from events? {/*what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events*/}

Before getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components:

- **Rendering code** (introduced in [Describing the UI](/learn/describing-the-ui)) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. [Rendering code must be pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Like a math formula, it should only _calculate_ the result, but not do anything else.

- **Event handlers** (introduced in [Adding Interactivity](/learn/adding-interactivity)) are nested functions inside your components that *do* things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain ["side effects"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) (they change the program's state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).

Sometimes this isn't enough. Consider a `ChatRoom` component that must connect to the chat server whenever it's visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it's a side effect) so it can't happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes `ChatRoom` to be displayed.

***Effects* let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event.** Sending a message in the chat is an *event* because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an *Effect* because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a [commit](/learn/render-and-commit) after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library).

<Note>

Here and later in this text, capitalized "Effect" refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect caused by rendering. To refer to the broader programming concept, we'll say "side effect".

</Note>


## You might not need an Effect {/*you-might-not-need-an-effect*/}

**Don't rush to add Effects to your components.** Keep in mind that Effects are typically used to "step out" of your React code and synchronize with some *external* system. This includes browser APIs, third-party widgets, network, and so on. If your Effect only adjusts some state based on other state, [you might not need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

## How to write an Effect {/*how-to-write-an-effect*/}

To write an Effect, follow these three steps:

1. **Declare an Effect.** By default, your Effect will run after every [commit](/learn/render-and-commit).
2. **Specify the Effect dependencies.** Most Effects should only re-run *when needed* rather than after every render. For example, a fade-in animation should only trigger when a component appears. Connecting and disconnecting to a chat room should only happen when the component appears and disappears, or when the chat room changes. You will learn how to control this by specifying *dependencies.*
3. **Add cleanup if needed.** Some Effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. For example, "connect" needs "disconnect", "subscribe" needs "unsubscribe", and "fetch" needs either "cancel" or "ignore". You will learn how to do this by returning a *cleanup function*.

Let's look at each of these steps in detail.

### Step 1: Declare an Effect {/*step-1-declare-an-effect*/}

To declare an Effect in your component, import the [`useEffect` Hook](/reference/react/useEffect) from React:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

Then, call it at the top level of your component and put some code inside your Effect:

```js {2-4}
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code here will run after *every* render
  });
  return <div />;
}
```

Every time your component renders, React will update the screen *and then* run the code inside `useEffect`. In other words, **`useEffect` "delays" a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.**

Let's see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a `<VideoPlayer>` React component. It would be nice to control whether it's playing or paused by passing an `isPlaying` prop to it:

```js
<VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} />;
```

Your custom `VideoPlayer` component renders the built-in browser [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) tag:

```js
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  // TODO: do something with isPlaying
  return <video src={src} />;
}
```

However, the browser `<video>` tag does not have an `isPlaying` prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the [`play()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/play) and [`pause()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/pause) methods on the DOM element. **You need to synchronize the value of `isPlaying` prop, which tells whether the video _should_ currently be playing, with calls like `play()` and `pause()`.**

We'll need to first [get a ref](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs) to the `<video>` DOM node.

You might be tempted to try to call `play()` or `pause()` during rendering, but that isn't correct:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7, 9]}}
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  if (isPlaying) {
    ref.current.play();  // Calling these while rendering isn't allowed.
  } else {
    ref.current.pause(); // Also, this crashes.
  }

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
video { width: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The reason this code isn't correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, [rendering should be a pure calculation](/learn/keeping-components-pure) of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM.

Moreover, when `VideoPlayer` is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn't a DOM node yet to call `play()` or `pause()` on, because React doesn't know what DOM to create until you return the JSX.

The solution here is to **wrap the side effect with `useEffect` to move it out of the rendering calculation:**

```js {6,12}
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}
```

By wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs.

When your `VideoPlayer` component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the `<video>` tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call `play()` or `pause()` depending on the value of `isPlaying`.

Press Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the `isPlaying` value:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
video { width: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In this example, the "external system" you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components.

Note that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling `play()` may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete.

<Pitfall>

By default, Effects run after *every* render. This is why code like this will **produce an infinite loop:**

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
});
```

Effects run as a *result* of rendering. Setting state *triggers* rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on.

Effects should usually synchronize your components with an *external* system. If there's no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, [you might not need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

</Pitfall>

### Step 2: Specify the Effect dependencies {/*step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies*/}

By default, Effects run after *every* render. Often, this is **not what you want:**

- Sometimes, it's slow. Synchronizing with an external system is not always instant, so you might want to skip doing it unless it's necessary. For example, you don't want to reconnect to the chat server on every keystroke.
- Sometimes, it's wrong. For example, you don't want to trigger a component fade-in animation on every keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time.

To demonstrate the issue, here is the previous example with a few `console.log` calls and a text input that updates the parent component's state. Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      console.log('Calling video.play()');
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      console.log('Calling video.pause()');
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  });

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
input, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
video { width: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

You can tell React to **skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect** by specifying an array of *dependencies* as the second argument to the `useEffect` call. Start by adding an empty `[]` array to the above example on line 14:

```js {3}
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
```

You should see an error saying `React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying'`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      console.log('Calling video.play()');
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      console.log('Calling video.pause()');
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, []); // This causes an error

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
input, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
video { width: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The problem is that the code inside of your Effect *depends on* the `isPlaying` prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add `isPlaying` to the dependency array:

```js {2,7}
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) { // It's used here...
      // ...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }, [isPlaying]); // ...so it must be declared here!
```

Now all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying `[isPlaying]` as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if `isPlaying` is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn't cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      console.log('Calling video.play()');
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      console.log('Calling video.pause()');
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying]);

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying={isPlaying}
        src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
input, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
video { width: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The dependency array can contain multiple dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if *all* of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. See the [`useEffect` reference](/reference/react/useEffect#reference) for details.

**Notice that you can't "choose" your dependencies.** You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don't match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don't want some code to re-run, [*edit the Effect code itself* to not "need" that dependency.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-to-do-when-you-dont-want-to-re-synchronize)

<Pitfall>

The behaviors without the dependency array and with an *empty* `[]` dependency array are different:

```js {3,7,11}
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after every render
});

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs only on mount (when the component appears)
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs on mount *and also* if either a or b have changed since the last render
}, [a, b]);
```

We'll take a close look at what "mount" means in the next step.

</Pitfall>

<DeepDive>

#### Why was the ref omitted from the dependency array? {/*why-was-the-ref-omitted-from-the-dependency-array*/}

This Effect uses _both_ `ref` and `isPlaying`, but only `isPlaying` is declared as a dependency:

```js {9}
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying]);
```

This is because the `ref` object has a *stable identity:* React guarantees [you'll always get the same object](/reference/react/useRef#returns) from the same `useRef` call on every render. It never changes, so it will never by itself cause the Effect to re-run. Therefore, it does not matter whether you include it or not. Including it is fine too:

```js {9}
function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying, ref]);
```

The [`set` functions](/reference/react/useState#setstate) returned by `useState` also have stable identity, so you will often see them omitted from the dependencies too. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do.

Omitting always-stable dependencies only works when the linter can "see" that the object is stable. For example, if `ref` was passed from a parent component, you would have to specify it in the dependency array. However, this is good because you can't know whether the parent component always passes the same ref, or passes one of several refs conditionally. So your Effect _would_ depend on which ref is passed.

</DeepDive>

### Step 3: Add cleanup if needed {/*step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed*/}

Consider a different example. You're writing a `ChatRoom` component that needs to connect to the chat server when it appears. You are given a `createConnection()` API that returns an object with `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods. How do you keep the component connected while it is displayed to the user?

Start by writing the Effect logic:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
});
```

It would be slow to connect to the chat after every re-render, so you add the dependency array:

```js {4}
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
}, []);
```

**The code inside the Effect does not use any props or state, so your dependency array is `[]` (empty). This tells React to only run this code when the component "mounts", i.e. appears on the screen for the first time.**

Let's try running this code:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection() {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected.');
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect `"✅ Connecting..."` to be printed once in the console. **However, if you check the console, `"✅ Connecting..."` gets printed twice. Why does it happen?**

Imagine the `ChatRoom` component is a part of a larger app with many different screens. The user starts their journey on the `ChatRoom` page. The component mounts and calls `connection.connect()`. Then imagine the user navigates to another screen--for example, to the Settings page. The `ChatRoom` component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and `ChatRoom` mounts again. This would set up a second connection--but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up.

Bugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount.

Seeing the `"✅ Connecting..."` log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn't close the connection when the component unmounts.

To fix the issue, return a *cleanup function* from your Effect:

```js {4-6}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []);
```

React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed). Let's see what happens when the cleanup function is implemented:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection() {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected.');
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Now you get three console logs in development:

1. `"✅ Connecting..."`
2. `"❌ Disconnected."`
3. `"✅ Connecting..."`

**This is the correct behavior in development.** By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again. There's an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal--don't try to make it go away!

**In production, you would only see `"✅ Connecting..."` printed once.** Remounting components only happens in development to help you find Effects that need cleanup. You can turn off [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) to opt out of the development behavior, but we recommend keeping it on. This lets you find many bugs like the one above.

## How to handle the Effect firing twice in development? {/*how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development*/}

React intentionally remounts your components in development to find bugs like in the last example. **The right question isn't "how to run an Effect once", but "how to fix my Effect so that it works after remounting".**

Usually, the answer is to implement the cleanup function.  The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the Effect was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn't be able to distinguish between the Effect running once (as in production) and a _setup → cleanup → setup_ sequence (as you'd see in development).

Most of the Effects you'll write will fit into one of the common patterns below.

<Pitfall>

#### Don't use refs to prevent Effects from firing {/*dont-use-refs-to-prevent-effects-from-firing*/}

A common pitfall for preventing Effects firing twice in development is to use a `ref` to prevent the Effect from running more than once. For example, you could "fix" the above bug with a `useRef`:

```js {1,3-4}
  const connectionRef = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    // 🚩 This wont fix the bug!!!
    if (!connectionRef.current) {
      connectionRef.current = createConnection();
      connectionRef.current.connect();
    }
  }, []);
```

This makes it so you only see `"✅ Connecting..."` once in development, but it doesn't fix the bug.

When the user navigates away, the connection still isn't closed and when they navigate back, a new connection is created. As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up, the same as it would before the "fix".

To fix the bug, it is not enough to just make the Effect run once. The effect needs to work after re-mounting, which means the connection needs to be cleaned up like in the solution above.

See the examples below for how to handle common patterns.

</Pitfall>

### Controlling non-React widgets {/*controlling-non-react-widgets*/}

Sometimes you need to add UI widgets that aren't written in React. For example, let's say you're adding a map component to your page. It has a `setZoomLevel()` method, and you'd like to keep the zoom level in sync with a `zoomLevel` state variable in your React code. Your Effect would look similar to this:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const map = mapRef.current;
  map.setZoomLevel(zoomLevel);
}, [zoomLevel]);
```

Note that there is no cleanup needed in this case. In development, React will call the Effect twice, but this is not a problem because calling `setZoomLevel` twice with the same value does not do anything. It may be slightly slower, but this doesn't matter because it won't remount needlessly in production.

Some APIs may not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the [`showModal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal) method of the built-in [`<dialog>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement) element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog:

```js {4}
useEffect(() => {
  const dialog = dialogRef.current;
  dialog.showModal();
  return () => dialog.close();
}, []);
```

In development, your Effect will call `showModal()`, then immediately `close()`, and then `showModal()` again. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling `showModal()` once, as you would see in production.

### Subscribing to events {/*subscribing-to-events*/}

If your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should unsubscribe:

```js {6}
useEffect(() => {
  function handleScroll(e) {
    console.log(window.scrollX, window.scrollY);
  }
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```

In development, your Effect will call `addEventListener()`, then immediately `removeEventListener()`, and then `addEventListener()` again with the same handler. So there would be only one active subscription at a time. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling `addEventListener()` once, as in production.

### Triggering animations {/*triggering-animations*/}

If your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values:

```js {4-6}
useEffect(() => {
  const node = ref.current;
  node.style.opacity = 1; // Trigger the animation
  return () => {
    node.style.opacity = 0; // Reset to the initial value
  };
}, []);
```

In development, opacity will be set to `1`, then to `0`, and then to `1` again. This should have the same user-visible behavior as setting it to `1` directly, which is what would happen in production. If you use a third-party animation library with support for tweening, your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state.

### Fetching data {/*fetching-data*/}

If your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either [abort the fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) or ignore its result:

```js {2,6,13-15}
useEffect(() => {
  let ignore = false;

  async function startFetching() {
    const json = await fetchTodos(userId);
    if (!ignore) {
      setTodos(json);
    }
  }

  startFetching();

  return () => {
    ignore = true;
  };
}, [userId]);
```

You can't "undo" a network request that already happened, but your cleanup function should ensure that the fetch that's _not relevant anymore_ does not keep affecting your application. If the `userId` changes from `'Alice'` to `'Bob'`, cleanup ensures that the `'Alice'` response is ignored even if it arrives after `'Bob'`.

**In development, you will see two fetches in the Network tab.** There is nothing wrong with that. With the approach above, the first Effect will immediately get cleaned up so its copy of the `ignore` variable will be set to `true`. So even though there is an extra request, it won't affect the state thanks to the `if (!ignore)` check.

**In production, there will only be one request.** If the second request in development is bothering you, the best approach is to use a solution that deduplicates requests and caches their responses between components:

```js
function TodoList() {
  const todos = useSomeDataLibrary(`/api/user/${userId}/todos`);
  // ...
```

This will not only improve the development experience, but also make your application feel faster. For example, the user pressing the Back button won't have to wait for some data to load again because it will be cached. You can either build such a cache yourself or use one of the many alternatives to manual fetching in Effects.

<DeepDive>

#### What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? {/*what-are-good-alternatives-to-data-fetching-in-effects*/}

Writing `fetch` calls inside Effects is a [popular way to fetch data](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/), especially in fully client-side apps. This is, however, a very manual approach and it has significant downsides:

- **Effects don't run on the server.** This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient.
- **Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create "network waterfalls".** You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data. If the network is not very fast, this is significantly slower than fetching all data in parallel.
- **Fetching directly in Effects usually means you don't preload or cache data.** For example, if the component unmounts and then mounts again, it would have to fetch the data again.
- **It's not very ergonomic.** There's quite a bit of boilerplate code involved when writing `fetch` calls in a way that doesn't suffer from bugs like [race conditions.](https://maxrozen.com/race-conditions-fetching-data-react-with-useeffect)

This list of downsides is not specific to React. It applies to fetching data on mount with any library. Like with routing, data fetching is not trivial to do well, so we recommend the following approaches:

- **If you use a [framework](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks), use its built-in data fetching mechanism.** Modern React frameworks have integrated data fetching mechanisms that are efficient and don't suffer from the above pitfalls.
- **Otherwise, consider using or building a client-side cache.** Popular open source solutions include [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and [React Router 6.4+.](https://beta.reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) You can build your own solution too, in which case you would use Effects under the hood, but add logic for deduplicating requests, caching responses, and avoiding network waterfalls (by preloading data or hoisting data requirements to routes).

You can continue fetching data directly in Effects if neither of these approaches suit you.

</DeepDive>

### Sending analytics {/*sending-analytics*/}

Consider this code that sends an analytics event on the page visit:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  logVisit(url); // Sends a POST request
}, [url]);
```

In development, `logVisit` will be called twice for every URL, so you might be tempted to try to fix that. **We recommend keeping this code as is.** Like with earlier examples, there is no *user-visible* behavior difference between running it once and running it twice. From a practical point of view, `logVisit` should not do anything in development because you don't want the logs from the development machines to skew the production metrics. Your component remounts every time you save its file, so it logs extra visits in development anyway.

**In production, there will be no duplicate visit logs.**

To debug the analytics events you're sending, you can deploy your app to a staging environment (which runs in production mode) or temporarily opt out of [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) and its development-only remounting checks. You may also send analytics from the route change event handlers instead of Effects. For more precise analytics, [intersection observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) can help track which components are in the viewport and how long they remain visible.

### Not an Effect: Initializing the application {/*not-an-effect-initializing-the-application*/}

Some logic should only run once when the application starts. You can put it outside your components:

```js {2-3}
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.
  checkAuthToken();
  loadDataFromLocalStorage();
}

function App() {
  // ...
}
```

This guarantees that such logic only runs once after the browser loads the page.

### Not an Effect: Buying a product {/*not-an-effect-buying-a-product*/}

Sometimes, even if you write a cleanup function, there's no way to prevent user-visible consequences of running the Effect twice. For example, maybe your Effect sends a POST request like buying a product:

```js {2-3}
useEffect(() => {
  // 🔴 Wrong: This Effect fires twice in development, exposing a problem in the code.
  fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });
}, []);
```

You wouldn't want to buy the product twice. However, this is also why you shouldn't put this logic in an Effect. What if the user goes to another page and then presses Back? Your Effect would run again. You don't want to buy the product when the user *visits* a page; you want to buy it when the user *clicks* the Buy button.

Buying is not caused by rendering; it's caused by a specific interaction. It should run only when the user presses the button. **Delete the Effect and move your `/api/buy` request into the Buy button event handler:**

```js {2-3}
  function handleClick() {
    // ✅ Buying is an event because it is caused by a particular interaction.
    fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });
  }
```

**This illustrates that if remounting breaks the logic of your application, this usually uncovers existing bugs.** From a user's perspective, visiting a page shouldn't be different from visiting it, clicking a link, then pressing Back to view the page again. React verifies that your components abide by this principle by remounting them once in development.

## Putting it all together {/*putting-it-all-together*/}

This playground can help you "get a feel" for how Effects work in practice.

This example uses [`setTimeout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) to schedule a console log with the input text to appear three seconds after the Effect runs. The cleanup function cancels the pending timeout. Start by pressing "Mount the component":

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Playground() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('a');

  useEffect(() => {
    function onTimeout() {
      console.log('⏰ ' + text);
    }

    console.log('🔵 Schedule "' + text + '" log');
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(onTimeout, 3000);

    return () => {
      console.log('🟡 Cancel "' + text + '" log');
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    };
  }, [text]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        What to log:{' '}
        <input
          value={text}
          onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <h1>{text}</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Unmount' : 'Mount'} the component
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <Playground />}
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

You will see three logs at first: `Schedule "a" log`, `Cancel "a" log`, and `Schedule "a" log` again. Three second later there will also be a log saying `a`. As you learned earlier, the extra schedule/cancel pair is because React remounts the component once in development to verify that you've implemented cleanup well.

Now edit the input to say `abc`. If you do it fast enough, you'll see `Schedule "ab" log` immediately followed by `Cancel "ab" log` and `Schedule "abc" log`. **React always cleans up the previous render's Effect before the next render's Effect.** This is why even if you type into the input fast, there is at most one timeout scheduled at a time. Edit the input a few times and watch the console to get a feel for how Effects get cleaned up.

Type something into the input and then immediately press "Unmount the component". Notice how unmounting cleans up the last render's Effect. Here, it clears the last timeout before it has a chance to fire.

Finally, edit the component above and comment out the cleanup function so that the timeouts don't get cancelled. Try typing `abcde` fast. What do you expect to happen in three seconds? Will `console.log(text)` inside the timeout print the *latest* `text` and produce five `abcde` logs? Give it a try to check your intuition!

Three seconds later, you should see a sequence of logs (`a`, `ab`, `abc`, `abcd`, and `abcde`) rather than five `abcde` logs. **Each Effect "captures" the `text` value from its corresponding render.**  It doesn't matter that the `text` state changed: an Effect from the render with `text = 'ab'` will always see `'ab'`. In other words, Effects from each render are isolated from each other. If you're curious how this works, you can read about [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

<DeepDive>

#### Each render has its own Effects {/*each-render-has-its-own-effects*/}

You can think of `useEffect` as "attaching" a piece of behavior to the render output. Consider this Effect:

```js
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  return <h1>Welcome to {roomId}!</h1>;
}
```

Let's see what exactly happens as the user navigates around the app.

#### Initial render {/*initial-render*/}

The user visits `<ChatRoom roomId="general" />`. Let's [mentally substitute](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time) `roomId` with `'general'`:

```js
  // JSX for the first render (roomId = "general")
  return <h1>Welcome to general!</h1>;
```

**The Effect is *also* a part of the rendering output.** The first render's Effect becomes:

```js
  // Effect for the first render (roomId = "general")
  () => {
    const connection = createConnection('general');
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  },
  // Dependencies for the first render (roomId = "general")
  ['general']
```

React runs this Effect, which connects to the `'general'` chat room.

#### Re-render with same dependencies {/*re-render-with-same-dependencies*/}

Let's say `<ChatRoom roomId="general" />` re-renders. The JSX output is the same:

```js
  // JSX for the second render (roomId = "general")
  return <h1>Welcome to general!</h1>;
```

React sees that the rendering output has not changed, so it doesn't update the DOM.

The Effect from the second render looks like this:

```js
  // Effect for the second render (roomId = "general")
  () => {
    const connection = createConnection('general');
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  },
  // Dependencies for the second render (roomId = "general")
  ['general']
```

React compares `['general']` from the second render with `['general']` from the first render. **Because all dependencies are the same, React *ignores* the Effect from the second render.** It never gets called.

#### Re-render with different dependencies {/*re-render-with-different-dependencies*/}

Then, the user visits `<ChatRoom roomId="travel" />`. This time, the component returns different JSX:

```js
  // JSX for the third render (roomId = "travel")
  return <h1>Welcome to travel!</h1>;
```

React updates the DOM to change `"Welcome to general"` into `"Welcome to travel"`.

The Effect from the third render looks like this:

```js
  // Effect for the third render (roomId = "travel")
  () => {
    const connection = createConnection('travel');
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  },
  // Dependencies for the third render (roomId = "travel")
  ['travel']
```

React compares `['travel']` from the third render with `['general']` from the second render. One dependency is different: `Object.is('travel', 'general')` is `false`. The Effect can't be skipped.

**Before React can apply the Effect from the third render, it needs to clean up the last Effect that _did_ run.** The second render's Effect was skipped, so React needs to clean up the first render's Effect. If you scroll up to the first render, you'll see that its cleanup calls `disconnect()` on the connection that was created with `createConnection('general')`. This disconnects the app from the `'general'` chat room.

After that, React runs the third render's Effect. It connects to the `'travel'` chat room.

#### Unmount {/*unmount*/}

Finally, let's say the user navigates away, and the `ChatRoom` component unmounts. React runs the last Effect's cleanup function. The last Effect was from the third render. The third render's cleanup destroys the `createConnection('travel')` connection. So the app disconnects from the `'travel'` room.

#### Development-only behaviors {/*development-only-behaviors*/}

When [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, React remounts every component once after mount (state and DOM are preserved). This [helps you find Effects that need cleanup](#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) and exposes bugs like race conditions early. Additionally, React will remount the Effects whenever you save a file in development. Both of these behaviors are development-only.

</DeepDive>

<Recap>

- Unlike events, Effects are caused by rendering itself rather than a particular interaction.
- Effects let you synchronize a component with some external system (third-party API, network, etc).
- By default, Effects run after every render (including the initial one).
- React will skip the Effect if all of its dependencies have the same values as during the last render.
- You can't "choose" your dependencies. They are determined by the code inside the Effect.
- Empty dependency array (`[]`) corresponds to the component "mounting", i.e. being added to the screen.
- In Strict Mode, React mounts components twice (in development only!) to stress-test your Effects.
- If your Effect breaks because of remounting, you need to implement a cleanup function.
- React will call your cleanup function before the Effect runs next time, and during the unmount.

</Recap>

<Challenges>

#### Focus a field on mount {/*focus-a-field-on-mount*/}

In this example, the form renders a `<MyInput />` component.

Use the input's [`focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) method to make `MyInput` automatically focus when it appears on the screen. There is already a commented out implementation, but it doesn't quite work. Figure out why it doesn't work, and fix it. (If you're familiar with the `autoFocus` attribute, pretend that it does not exist: we are reimplementing the same functionality from scratch.)

<Sandpack>

```js src/MyInput.js active
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export default function MyInput({ value, onChange }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  // TODO: This doesn't quite work. Fix it.
  // ref.current.focus()

  return (
    <input
      ref={ref}
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import MyInput from './MyInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [upper, setUpper] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(s => !s)}>{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} form</button>
      <br />
      <hr />
      {show && (
        <>
          <label>
            Enter your name:
            <MyInput
              value={name}
              onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
            />
          </label>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={upper}
              onChange={e => setUpper(e.target.checked)}
            />
            Make it uppercase
          </label>
          <p>Hello, <b>{upper ? name.toUpperCase() : name}</b></p>
        </>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

body {
  min-height: 150px;
}
```

</Sandpack>


To verify that your solution works, press "Show form" and verify that the input receives focus (becomes highlighted and the cursor is placed inside). Press "Hide form" and "Show form" again. Verify the input is highlighted again.

`MyInput` should only focus _on mount_ rather than after every render. To verify that the behavior is right, press "Show form" and then repeatedly press the "Make it uppercase" checkbox. Clicking the checkbox should _not_ focus the input above it.

<Solution>

Calling `ref.current.focus()` during render is wrong because it is a *side effect*. Side effects should either be placed inside an event handler or be declared with `useEffect`. In this case, the side effect is _caused_ by the component appearing rather than by any specific interaction, so it makes sense to put it in an Effect.

To fix the mistake, wrap the `ref.current.focus()` call into an Effect declaration. Then, to ensure that this Effect runs only on mount rather than after every render, add the empty `[]` dependencies to it.

<Sandpack>

```js src/MyInput.js active
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export default function MyInput({ value, onChange }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current.focus();
  }, []);

  return (
    <input
      ref={ref}
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import MyInput from './MyInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [upper, setUpper] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(s => !s)}>{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} form</button>
      <br />
      <hr />
      {show && (
        <>
          <label>
            Enter your name:
            <MyInput
              value={name}
              onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
            />
          </label>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={upper}
              onChange={e => setUpper(e.target.checked)}
            />
            Make it uppercase
          </label>
          <p>Hello, <b>{upper ? name.toUpperCase() : name}</b></p>

#### Focus a field conditionally {/*focus-a-field-conditionally*/}

This form renders two `<MyInput />` components.

Press "Show form" and notice that the second field automatically gets focused. This is because both of the `<MyInput />` components try to focus the field inside. When you call `focus()` for two input fields in a row, the last one always "wins".

Let's say you want to focus the first field. The first `MyInput` component now receives a boolean `shouldFocus` prop set to `true`. Change the logic so that `focus()` is only called if the `shouldFocus` prop received by `MyInput` is `true`.

<Sandpack>

```js src/MyInput.js active
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export default function MyInput({ shouldFocus, value, onChange }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  // TODO: call focus() only if shouldFocus is true.
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current.focus();
  }, []);

  return (
    <input
      ref={ref}
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import MyInput from './MyInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  const [upper, setUpper] = useState(false);
  const name = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(s => !s)}>{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} form</button>
      <br />
      <hr />
      {show && (
        <>
          <label>
            Enter your first name:
            <MyInput
              value={firstName}
              onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)}
              shouldFocus={true}
            />
          </label>
          <label>
            Enter your last name:
            <MyInput
              value={lastName}
              onChange={e => setLastName(e.target.value)}
              shouldFocus={false}
            />
          </label>
          <p>Hello, <b>{upper ? name.toUpperCase() : name}</b></p>
        </>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

body {
  min-height: 150px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

To verify your solution, press "Show form" and "Hide form" repeatedly. When the form appears, only the *first* input should get focused. This is because the parent component renders the first input with `shouldFocus={true}` and the second input with `shouldFocus={false}`. Also check that both inputs still work and you can type into both of them.

<Hint>

You can't declare an Effect conditionally, but your Effect can include conditional logic.

</Hint>

<Solution>

Put the conditional logic inside the Effect. You will need to specify `shouldFocus` as a dependency because you are using it inside the Effect. (This means that if some input's `shouldFocus` changes from `false` to `true`, it will focus after mount.)

<Sandpack>

```js src/MyInput.js active
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export default function MyInput({ shouldFocus, value, onChange }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (shouldFocus) {
      ref.current.focus();
    }
  }, [shouldFocus]);

  return (
    <input
      ref={ref}
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import MyInput from './MyInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  const [upper, setUpper] = useState(false);
  const name = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(s => !s)}>{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} form</button>

#### Fix an interval that fires twice {/*fix-an-interval-that-fires-twice*/}

This `Counter` component displays a counter that should increment every second. On mount, it calls [`setInterval`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) This causes `onTick` to run every second. The `onTick` function increments the counter.

However, instead of incrementing once per second, it increments twice. Why is that? Find the cause of the bug and fix it.

<Hint>

Keep in mind that `setInterval` returns an interval ID, which you can pass to [`clearInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval) to stop the interval.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/Counter.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    function onTick() {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }

    setInterval(onTick, 1000);
  }, []);

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter.js';

export default function Form() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(s => !s)}>{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} counter</button>
      <br />
      <hr />
      {show && <Counter />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

body {
  min-height: 150px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

When [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on (like in the sandboxes on this site), React remounts each component once in development. This causes the interval to be set up twice, and this is why each second the counter increments twice.

However, React's behavior is not the *cause* of the bug: the bug already exists in the code. React's behavior makes the bug more noticeable. The real cause is that this Effect starts a process but doesn't provide a way to clean it up.

To fix this code, save the interval ID returned by `setInterval`, and implement a cleanup function with [`clearInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval):

<Sandpack>

```js src/Counter.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    function onTick() {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }

    const intervalId = setInterval(onTick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter.js';

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(s => !s)}>{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} counter</button>
      <br />
      <hr />
      {show && <Counter />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

body {
  min-height: 150px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In development, React will still remount your component once to verify that you've implemented cleanup well. So there will be a `setInterval` call, immediately followed by `clearInterval`, and `setInterval` again. In production, there will be only one `setInterval` call. The user-visible behavior in both cases is the same: the counter increments once per second.

</Solution>

#### Fix fetching inside an Effect {/*fix-fetching-inside-an-effect*/}

This component shows the biography for the selected person. It loads the biography by calling an asynchronous function `fetchBio(person)` on mount and whenever `person` changes. That asynchronous function returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which eventually resolves to a string. When fetching is done, it calls `setBio` to display that string under the select box.

<Sandpack>

{/* not the most efficient, but this validation is enabled in the linter only, so it's fine to ignore it here since we know what we're doing */}
```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [9]}} src/App.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchBio } from './api.js';

export default function Page() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');
  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setBio(null);
    fetchBio(person).then(result => {
      setBio(result);
    });
  }, [person]);

  return (
    <>
      <select value={person} onChange={e => {
        setPerson(e.target.value);
      }}>
        <option value="Alice">Alice</option>
        <option value="Bob">Bob</option>
        <option value="Taylor">Taylor</option>
      </select>
      <hr />
      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/api.js hidden
export async function fetchBio(person) {
  const delay = person === 'Bob' ? 2000 : 200;
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('This is ' + person + '’s bio.');
    }, delay);
  })
}

```

</Sandpack>


There is a bug in this code. Start by selecting "Alice". Then select "Bob" and then immediately after that select "Taylor". If you do this fast enough, you will notice that bug: Taylor is selected, but the paragraph below says "This is Bob's bio."

Why does this happen? Fix the bug inside this Effect.

<Hint>

If an Effect fetches something asynchronously, it usually needs cleanup.

</Hint>

<Solution>

To trigger the bug, things need to happen in this order:

- Selecting `'Bob'` triggers `fetchBio('Bob')`
- Selecting `'Taylor'` triggers `fetchBio('Taylor')`
- **Fetching `'Taylor'` completes *before* fetching `'Bob'`**
- The Effect from the `'Taylor'` render calls `setBio('This is Taylor’s bio')`
- Fetching `'Bob'` completes
- The Effect from the `'Bob'` render calls `setBio('This is Bob’s bio')`

This is why you see Bob's bio even though Taylor is selected. Bugs like this are called [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) because two asynchronous operations are "racing" with each other, and they might arrive in an unexpected order.

To fix this race condition, add a cleanup function:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [9]}} src/App.js

    let ignore = false;
    setBio(null);
    fetchBio(person).then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        setBio(result);
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, [person]);

  return (
    <>
      <select value={person} onChange={e => {

        <option value="Alice">Alice</option>

      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/api.js hidden
export async function fetchBio(person) {
  const delay = person === 'Bob' ? 2000 : 200;
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('This is ' + person + '’s bio.');
    }, delay);
  })
}

```

</Sandpack>

Each render's Effect has its own `ignore` variable. Initially, the `ignore` variable is set to `false`. However, if an Effect gets cleaned up (such as when you select a different person), its `ignore` variable becomes `true`. So now it doesn't matter in which order the requests complete. Only the last person's Effect will have `ignore` set to `false`, so it will call `setBio(result)`. Past Effects have been cleaned up, so the `if (!ignore)` check will prevent them from calling `setBio`:

- Selecting `'Bob'` triggers `fetchBio('Bob')`
- Selecting `'Taylor'` triggers `fetchBio('Taylor')` **and cleans up the previous (Bob's) Effect**
- Fetching `'Taylor'` completes *before* fetching `'Bob'`
- The Effect from the `'Taylor'` render calls `setBio('This is Taylor’s bio')`
- Fetching `'Bob'` completes
- The Effect from the `'Bob'` render **does not do anything because its `ignore` flag was set to `true`**

In addition to ignoring the result of an outdated API call, you can also use [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) to cancel the requests that are no longer needed. However, by itself this is not enough to protect against race conditions. More asynchronous steps could be chained after the fetch, so using an explicit flag like `ignore` is the most reliable way to fix this type of problem.

title: 'You Might Not Need an Effect'
---

<Intro>

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you "step outside" of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component's state when some props or state change), you shouldn't need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

</YouWillLearn>

## How to remove unnecessary Effects {/*how-to-remove-unnecessary-effects*/}

There are two common cases in which you don't need Effects:

* **You don't need Effects to transform data for rendering.** For example, let's say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will ["commit"](/learn/render-and-commit) these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect *also* immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
* **You don't need Effects to handle user events.** For example, let's say you want to send an `/api/buy` POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don't know *what* the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you'll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.

You *do* need Effects to [synchronize](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events) with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state. You can also fetch data with Effects: for example, you can synchronize the search results with the current search query. Keep in mind that modern [frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.

To help you gain the right intuition, let's look at some common concrete examples!

### Updating state based on props or state {/*updating-state-based-on-props-or-state*/}

Suppose you have a component with two state variables: `firstName` and `lastName`. You want to calculate a `fullName` from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you'd like `fullName` to update whenever `firstName` or `lastName` change. Your first instinct might be to add a `fullName` state variable and update it in an Effect:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [8]}} {5-9}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```

This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for `fullName`, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect:

```js {4-5}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```

**When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, [don't put it in state.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) Instead, calculate it during rendering.** This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra "cascading" updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react#step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state) explains what should go into state.

### Caching expensive calculations {/*caching-expensive-calculations*/}

This component computes `visibleTodos` by taking the `todos` it receives by props and filtering them according to the `filter` prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in state and update it from an Effect:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7]}} {4-8}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(getFilteredTodos(todos, filter));
  }, [todos, filter]);

  // ...
}
```

Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:

```js {3-4}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // ✅ This is fine if getFilteredTodos() is not slow.
  const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  // ...
}
```

Usually, this code is fine! But maybe `getFilteredTodos()` is slow or you have a lot of `todos`. In that case you don't want to recalculate `getFilteredTodos()` if some unrelated state variable like `newTodo` has changed.

You can cache (or ["memoize"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)) an expensive calculation by wrapping it in a [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) Hook:

<Note>

[React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) can automatically memoize expensive calculations for you, eliminating the need for manual `useMemo` in many cases.

</Note>

```js {5-8}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // ✅ Does not re-run unless todos or filter change
    return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  }, [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

Or, written as a single line:

```js {5-6}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // ✅ Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

**This tells React that you don't want the inner function to re-run unless either `todos` or `filter` have changed.** React will remember the return value of `getFilteredTodos()` during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if `todos` or `filter` are different. If they're the same as last time, `useMemo` will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the inner function again (and store its result).

The function you wrap in [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) runs during rendering, so this only works for [pure calculations.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

<DeepDive>

#### How to tell if a calculation is expensive? {/*how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive*/}

In general, unless you're creating or looping over thousands of objects, it's probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:

```js {1,3}
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

Perform the interaction you're measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like `filter array: 0.15ms` in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, `1ms` or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in `useMemo` to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:

```js
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
  return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); // Skipped if todos and filter haven't changed
}, [todos, filter]);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

`useMemo` won't make the *first* render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.

Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users' so it's a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a [CPU Throttling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling) option for this.

Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.

### Resetting all state when a prop changes {/*resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes*/}

This `ProfilePage` component receives a `userId` prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a `comment` state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the `comment` state does not get reset. As a result, it's easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user's profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the `comment` state variable whenever the `userId` changes:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [6]}} {4-7}
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setComment('');
  }, [userId]);
  // ...
}
```

This is inefficient because `ProfilePage` and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you'd need to do this in *every* component that has some state inside `ProfilePage`. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you'd want to clear out nested comment state too.

Instead, you can tell React that each user's profile is conceptually a _different_ profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a `key` attribute from the outer component to the inner one:

```js {5,11-12}
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  return (
    <Profile
      userId={userId}
      key={userId}
    />
  );
}

function Profile({ userId }) {
  // ✅ This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');
  // ...
}
```

Normally, React preserves the state when the same component is rendered in the same spot. **By passing `userId` as a `key` to the `Profile` component, you're asking React to treat two `Profile` components with different `userId` as two different components that should not share any state.** Whenever the key (which you've set to `userId`) changes, React will recreate the DOM and [reset the state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#option-2-resetting-state-with-a-key) of the `Profile` component and all of its children. Now the `comment` field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles.

Note that in this example, only the outer `ProfilePage` component is exported and visible to other files in the project. Components rendering `ProfilePage` don't need to pass the key to it: they pass `userId` as a regular prop. The fact `ProfilePage` passes it as a `key` to the inner `Profile` component is an implementation detail.

### Adjusting some state when a prop changes {/*adjusting-some-state-when-a-prop-changes*/}

Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.

This `List` component receives a list of `items` as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the `selection` state variable. You want to reset the `selection` to `null` whenever the `items` prop receives a different array:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7]}} {5-8}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // 🔴 Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelection(null);
  }, [items]);
  // ...
}
```

This, too, is not ideal. Every time the `items` change, the `List` and its child components will render with a stale `selection` value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the `setSelection(null)` call will cause another re-render of the `List` and its child components, restarting this whole process again.

Start by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering:

```js {5-11}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // Better: Adjust the state while rendering
  const [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items);
  if (items !== prevItems) {
    setPrevItems(items);
    setSelection(null);
  }
  // ...
}
```

[Storing information from previous renders](/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) like this can be hard to understand, but it’s better than updating the same state in an Effect. In the above example, `setSelection` is called directly during a render. React will re-render the `List` *immediately* after it exits with a `return` statement. React has not rendered the `List` children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the `List` children skip rendering the stale `selection` value.

When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the *same* component's state during a render. If you update another component's state during a render, you'll see an error. A condition like `items !== prevItems` is necessary to avoid loops. You may adjust state like this, but any other side effects (like changing the DOM or setting timeouts) should stay in event handlers or Effects to [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

**Although this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldn't need it either.** No matter how you do it, adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can [reset all state with a key](#resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes) or [calculate everything during rendering](#updating-state-based-on-props-or-state) instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected *item*, you can store the selected *item ID:*

```js {3-5}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
  // ✅ Best: Calculate everything during rendering
  const selection = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId) ?? null;
  // ...
}
```

Now there is no need to "adjust" the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it's not, the `selection` calculated during rendering will be `null` because no matching item was found. This behavior is different, but arguably better because most changes to `items` preserve the selection.

### Sharing logic between event handlers {/*sharing-logic-between-event-handlers*/}

Let's say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Calling `showNotification()` in both buttons' click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect:

```js {2-7}
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (product.isInCart) {
      showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);
    }
  }, [product]);

  function handleBuyClick() {
    addToCart(product);
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    addToCart(product);
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```

This Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let's say that your app "remembers" the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product's page. This is because `product.isInCart` will already be `true` on the page load, so the Effect above will call `showNotification()`.

**When you're not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself *why* this code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run *because* the component was displayed to the user.** In this example, the notification should appear because the user *pressed the button*, not because the page was displayed! Delete the Effect and put the shared logic into a function called from both event handlers:

```js {2-6,9,13}
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers
  function buyProduct() {
    addToCart(product);
    showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);
  }

  function handleBuyClick() {
    buyProduct();
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    buyProduct();
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```

This both removes the unnecessary Effect and fixes the bug.

### Sending a POST request {/*sending-a-post-request*/}

This `Form` component sends two kinds of POST requests. It sends an analytics event when it mounts. When you fill in the form and click the Submit button, it will send a POST request to the `/api/register` endpoint:

```js {5-8,10-16}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  // ✅ Good: This logic should run because the component was displayed
  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });
  }, []);

  // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  const [jsonToSubmit, setJsonToSubmit] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (jsonToSubmit !== null) {
      post('/api/register', jsonToSubmit);
    }
  }, [jsonToSubmit]);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setJsonToSubmit({ firstName, lastName });
  }
  // ...
}
```

Let's apply the same criteria as in the example before.

The analytics POST request should remain in an Effect. This is because the _reason_ to send the analytics event is that the form was displayed. (It would fire twice in development, but [see here](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#sending-analytics) for how to deal with that.)

However, the `/api/register` POST request is not caused by the form being _displayed_. You only want to send the request at one specific moment in time: when the user presses the button. It should only ever happen _on that particular interaction_. Delete the second Effect and move that POST request into the event handler:

```js {12-13}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  // ✅ Good: This logic runs because the component was displayed
  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });
  }, []);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is in the event handler
    post('/api/register', { firstName, lastName });
  }
  // ...
}
```

When you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is _what kind of logic_ it is from the user's perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If it's caused by the user _seeing_ the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect.

### Chains of computations {/*chains-of-computations*/}

Sometimes you might feel tempted to chain Effects that each adjust a piece of state based on other state:

```js {7-29}
function Game() {
  const [card, setCard] = useState(null);
  const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0);
  const [round, setRound] = useState(1);
  const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false);

  // 🔴 Avoid: Chains of Effects that adjust the state solely to trigger each other
  useEffect(() => {
    if (card !== null && card.gold) {
      setGoldCardCount(c => c + 1);
    }
  }, [card]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (goldCardCount > 3) {
      setRound(r => r + 1)
      setGoldCardCount(0);
    }
  }, [goldCardCount]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (round > 5) {
      setIsGameOver(true);
    }
  }, [round]);

  useEffect(() => {
    alert('Good game!');
  }, [isGameOver]);

  function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) {
    if (isGameOver) {
      throw Error('Game already ended.');
    } else {
      setCard(nextCard);
    }
  }

  // ...
```

There are two problems with this code.

The first problem is that it is very inefficient: the component (and its children) have to re-render between each `set` call in the chain. In the example above, in the worst case (`setCard` → render → `setGoldCardCount` → render → `setRound` → render → `setIsGameOver` → render) there are three unnecessary re-renders of the tree below.

The second problem is that even if it weren't slow, as your code evolves, you will run into cases where the "chain" you wrote doesn't fit the new requirements. Imagine you are adding a way to step through the history of the game moves. You'd do it by updating each state variable to a value from the past. However, setting the `card` state to a value from the past would trigger the Effect chain again and change the data you're showing. Such code is often rigid and fragile.

In this case, it's better to calculate what you can during rendering, and adjust the state in the event handler:

```js {6-7,14-26}
function Game() {
  const [card, setCard] = useState(null);
  const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0);
  const [round, setRound] = useState(1);

  // ✅ Calculate what you can during rendering
  const isGameOver = round > 5;

  function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) {
    if (isGameOver) {
      throw Error('Game already ended.');
    }

    // ✅ Calculate all the next state in the event handler
    setCard(nextCard);
    if (nextCard.gold) {
      if (goldCardCount < 3) {
        setGoldCardCount(goldCardCount + 1);
      } else {
        setGoldCardCount(0);
        setRound(round + 1);
        if (round === 5) {
          alert('Good game!');
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // ...
```

This is a lot more efficient. Also, if you implement a way to view game history, now you will be able to set each state variable to a move from the past without triggering the Effect chain that adjusts every other value. If you need to reuse logic between several event handlers, you can [extract a function](#sharing-logic-between-event-handlers) and call it from those handlers.

Remember that inside event handlers, [state behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) For example, even after you call `setRound(round + 1)`, the `round` variable will reflect the value at the time the user clicked the button. If you need to use the next value for calculations, define it manually like `const nextRound = round + 1`.

In some cases, you *can't* calculate the next state directly in the event handler. For example, imagine a form with multiple dropdowns where the options of the next dropdown depend on the selected value of the previous dropdown. Then, a chain of Effects is appropriate because you are synchronizing with network.

### Initializing the application {/*initializing-the-application*/}

Some logic should only run once when the app loads.

You might be tempted to place it in an Effect in the top-level component:

```js {2-6}
function App() {
  // 🔴 Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once
  useEffect(() => {
    loadDataFromLocalStorage();
    checkAuthToken();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

However, you'll quickly discover that it [runs twice in development.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development) This can cause issues--for example, maybe it invalidates the authentication token because the function wasn't designed to be called twice. In general, your components should be resilient to being remounted. This includes your top-level `App` component.

Although it may not ever get remounted in practice in production, following the same constraints in all components makes it easier to move and reuse code. If some logic must run *once per app load* rather than *once per component mount*, add a top-level variable to track whether it has already executed:

```js {1,5-6,10}
let didInit = false;

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!didInit) {
      didInit = true;
      // ✅ Only runs once per app load
      loadDataFromLocalStorage();
      checkAuthToken();
    }
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

You can also run it during module initialization and before the app renders:

```js {1,5}
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.
   // ✅ Only runs once per app load
  checkAuthToken();
  loadDataFromLocalStorage();
}

function App() {
  // ...
}
```

Code at the top level runs once when your component is imported--even if it doesn't end up being rendered. To avoid slowdown or surprising behavior when importing arbitrary components, don't overuse this pattern. Keep app-wide initialization logic to root component modules like `App.js` or in your application's entry point.

### Notifying parent components about state changes {/*notifying-parent-components-about-state-changes*/}

Let's say you're writing a `Toggle` component with an internal `isOn` state which can be either `true` or `false`. There are a few different ways to toggle it (by clicking or dragging). You want to notify the parent component whenever the `Toggle` internal state changes, so you expose an `onChange` event and call it from an Effect:

```js {4-7}
function Toggle({ onChange }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  // 🔴 Avoid: The onChange handler runs too late
  useEffect(() => {
    onChange(isOn);
  }, [isOn, onChange])

  function handleClick() {
    setIsOn(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      setIsOn(true);
    } else {
      setIsOn(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

Like earlier, this is not ideal. The `Toggle` updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the `onChange` function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass.

Delete the Effect and instead update the state of *both* components within the same event handler:

```js {5-7,11,16,18}
function Toggle({ onChange }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  function updateToggle(nextIsOn) {
    // ✅ Good: Perform all updates during the event that caused them
    setIsOn(nextIsOn);
    onChange(nextIsOn);
  }

  function handleClick() {
    updateToggle(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      updateToggle(true);
    } else {
      updateToggle(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

With this approach, both the `Toggle` component and its parent component update their state during the event. React [batches updates](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) from different components together, so there will only be one render pass.

You might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive `isOn` from the parent component:

```js {1,2}
// ✅ Also good: the component is fully controlled by its parent
function Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) {
  function handleClick() {
    onChange(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      onChange(true);
    } else {
      onChange(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

["Lifting state up"](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) lets the parent component fully control the `Toggle` by toggling the parent's own state. This means the parent component will have to contain more logic, but there will be less state overall to worry about. Whenever you try to keep two different state variables synchronized, try lifting state up instead!

### Passing data to the parent {/*passing-data-to-the-parent*/}

This `Child` component fetches some data and then passes it to the `Parent` component in an Effect:

```js {9-14}
function Parent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  // ...
  return <Child onFetched={setData} />;
}

function Child({ onFetched }) {
  const data = useSomeAPI();
  // 🔴 Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (data) {
      onFetched(data);
    }
  }, [onFetched, data]);
  // ...
}
```

In React, data flows from the parent components to their children. When you see something wrong on the screen, you can trace where the information comes from by going up the component chain until you find which component passes the wrong prop or has the wrong state. When child components update the state of their parent components in Effects, the data flow becomes very difficult to trace. Since both the child and the parent need the same data, let the parent component fetch that data, and *pass it down* to the child instead:

```js {4-5}
function Parent() {
  const data = useSomeAPI();
  // ...
  // ✅ Good: Passing data down to the child
  return <Child data={data} />;
}

function Child({ data }) {
  // ...
}
```

This is simpler and keeps the data flow predictable: the data flows down from the parent to the child.

### Subscribing to an external store {/*subscribing-to-an-external-store*/}

Sometimes, your components may need to subscribe to some data outside of the React state. This data could be from a third-party library or a built-in browser API. Since this data can change without React's knowledge, you need to manually subscribe your components to it. This is often done with an Effect, for example:

```js {2-17}
function useOnlineStatus() {
  // Not ideal: Manual store subscription in an Effect
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function updateState() {
      setIsOnline(navigator.onLine);
    }

    updateState();

    window.addEventListener('online', updateState);
    window.addEventListener('offline', updateState);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', updateState);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', updateState);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

Here, the component subscribes to an external data store (in this case, the browser `navigator.onLine` API). Since this API does not exist on the server (so it can't be used for the initial HTML), initially the state is set to `true`. Whenever the value of that data store changes in the browser, the component updates its state.

Although it's common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore):

```js {11-16}
function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}

function useOnlineStatus() {
  // ✅ Good: Subscribing to an external store with a built-in Hook
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe, // React won't resubscribe for as long as you pass the same function
    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client
    () => true // How to get the value on the server
  );
}

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

This approach is less error-prone than manually syncing mutable data to React state with an Effect. Typically, you'll write a custom Hook like `useOnlineStatus()` above so that you don't need to repeat this code in the individual components. [Read more about subscribing to external stores from React components.](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)

### Fetching data {/*fetching-data*/}

Many apps use Effects to kick off data fetching. It is quite common to write a data fetching Effect like this:

```js {5-10}
function SearchResults({ query }) {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    // 🔴 Avoid: Fetching without cleanup logic
    fetchResults(query, page).then(json => {
      setResults(json);
    });
  }, [query, page]);

  function handleNextPageClick() {
    setPage(page + 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

You *don't* need to move this fetch to an event handler.

This might seem like a contradiction with the earlier examples where you needed to put the logic into the event handlers! However, consider that it's not *the typing event* that's the main reason to fetch. Search inputs are often prepopulated from the URL, and the user might navigate Back and Forward without touching the input.

It doesn't matter where `page` and `query` come from. While this component is visible, you want to keep `results` [synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with data from the network for the current `page` and `query`. This is why it's an Effect.

However, the code above has a bug. Imagine you type `"hello"` fast. Then the `query` will change from `"h"`, to `"he"`, `"hel"`, `"hell"`, and `"hello"`. This will kick off separate fetches, but there is no guarantee about which order the responses will arrive in. For example, the `"hell"` response may arrive *after* the `"hello"` response. Since it will call `setResults()` last, you will be displaying the wrong search results. This is called a ["race condition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition): two different requests "raced" against each other and came in a different order than you expected.

**To fix the race condition, you need to [add a cleanup function](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#fetching-data) to ignore stale responses:**

```js {5,7,9,11-13}
function SearchResults({ query }) {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetchResults(query, page).then(json => {
      if (!ignore) {
        setResults(json);
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [query, page]);

  function handleNextPageClick() {
    setPage(page + 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

This ensures that when your Effect fetches data, all responses except the last requested one will be ignored.

Handling race conditions is not the only difficulty with implementing data fetching. You might also want to think about caching responses (so that the user can click Back and see the previous screen instantly), how to fetch data on the server (so that the initial server-rendered HTML contains the fetched content instead of a spinner), and how to avoid network waterfalls (so that a child can fetch data without waiting for every parent).

**These issues apply to any UI library, not just React. Solving them is not trivial, which is why modern [frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than fetching data in Effects.**

If you don't use a framework (and don't want to build your own) but would like to make data fetching from Effects more ergonomic, consider extracting your fetching logic into a custom Hook like in this example:

```js {4}
function SearchResults({ query }) {
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ query, page });
  const results = useData(`/api/search?${params}`);

  function handleNextPageClick() {
    setPage(page + 1);
  }
  // ...
}

function useData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setData(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [url]);
  return data;
}
```

You'll likely also want to add some logic for error handling and to track whether the content is loading. You can build a Hook like this yourself or use one of the many solutions already available in the React ecosystem. **Although this alone won't be as efficient as using a framework's built-in data fetching mechanism, moving the data fetching logic into a custom Hook will make it easier to adopt an efficient data fetching strategy later.**

In general, whenever you have to resort to writing Effects, keep an eye out for when you can extract a piece of functionality into a custom Hook with a more declarative and purpose-built API like `useData` above. The fewer raw `useEffect` calls you have in your components, the easier you will find to maintain your application.

<Recap>

- If you can calculate something during render, you don't need an Effect.
- To cache expensive calculations, add `useMemo` instead of `useEffect`.
- To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different `key` to it.
- To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.
- Code that runs because a component was *displayed* should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.
- If you need to update the state of several components, it's better to do it during a single event.
- Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.
- You can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions.

#### Transform data without Effects {/*transform-data-without-effects*/}

The `TodoList` below displays a list of todos. When the "Show only active todos" checkbox is ticked, completed todos are not displayed in the list. Regardless of which todos are visible, the footer displays the count of todos that are not yet completed.

Simplify this component by removing all the unnecessary state and Effects.

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [12, 16, 20]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { initialTodos, createTodo } from './todos.js';

export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(initialTodos);
  const [showActive, setShowActive] = useState(false);
  const [activeTodos, setActiveTodos] = useState([]);
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);
  const [footer, setFooter] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setActiveTodos(todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed));
  }, [todos]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(showActive ? activeTodos : todos);
  }, [showActive, todos, activeTodos]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setFooter(
      <footer>
        {activeTodos.length} todos left
      </footer>
    );
  }, [activeTodos]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showActive}
          onChange={e => setShowActive(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Show only active todos
      </label>
      <NewTodo onAdd={newTodo => setTodos([...todos, newTodo])} />
      <ul>
        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.completed ? <s>{todo.text}</s> : todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {footer}
    </>
  );
}

function NewTodo({ onAdd }) {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  function handleAddClick() {
    setText('');
    onAdd(createTodo(text));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleAddClick}>
        Add
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/todos.js
let nextId = 0;

export function createTodo(text, completed = false) {
  return {
    id: nextId++,
    text,
    completed
  };
}

export const initialTodos = [
  createTodo('Get apples', true),
  createTodo('Get oranges', true),
  createTodo('Get carrots'),
];
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Hint>

If you can calculate something during rendering, you don't need state or an Effect that updates it.

</Hint>

<Solution>

There are only two essential pieces of state in this example: the list of `todos` and the `showActive` state variable which represents whether the checkbox is ticked. All of the other state variables are [redundant](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) and can be calculated during rendering instead. This includes the `footer` which you can move directly into the surrounding JSX.

Your result should end up looking like this:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { initialTodos, createTodo } from './todos.js';

export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(initialTodos);
  const [showActive, setShowActive] = useState(false);
  const activeTodos = todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
  const visibleTodos = showActive ? activeTodos : todos;

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showActive}
          onChange={e => setShowActive(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Show only active todos
      </label>
      <NewTodo onAdd={newTodo => setTodos([...todos, newTodo])} />
      <ul>
        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.completed ? <s>{todo.text}</s> : todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <footer>
        {activeTodos.length} todos left
      </footer>
    </>
  );
}

function NewTodo({ onAdd }) {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  function handleAddClick() {
    setText('');
    onAdd(createTodo(text));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleAddClick}>
        Add
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/todos.js
let nextId = 0;

export function createTodo(text, completed = false) {
  return {
    id: nextId++,
    text,
    completed
  };
}

export const initialTodos = [
  createTodo('Get apples', true),
  createTodo('Get oranges', true),
  createTodo('Get carrots'),
];
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Cache a calculation without Effects {/*cache-a-calculation-without-effects*/}

In this example, filtering the todos was extracted into a separate function called `getVisibleTodos()`. This function contains a `console.log()` call inside of it which helps you notice when it's being called. Toggle "Show only active todos" and notice that it causes `getVisibleTodos()` to re-run. This is expected because visible todos change when you toggle which ones to display.

Your task is to remove the Effect that recomputes the `visibleTodos` list in the `TodoList` component. However, you need to make sure that `getVisibleTodos()` does *not* re-run (and so does not print any logs) when you type into the input.

<Hint>

One solution is to add a `useMemo` call to cache the visible todos. There is also another, less obvious solution.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [11]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { initialTodos, createTodo, getVisibleTodos } from './todos.js';

export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(initialTodos);
  const [showActive, setShowActive] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(getVisibleTodos(todos, showActive));
  }, [todos, showActive]);

  function handleAddClick() {
    setText('');
    setTodos([...todos, createTodo(text)]);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showActive}
          onChange={e => setShowActive(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Show only active todos
      </label>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleAddClick}>
        Add
      </button>
      <ul>
        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.completed ? <s>{todo.text}</s> : todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/todos.js
let nextId = 0;
let calls = 0;

export function getVisibleTodos(todos, showActive) {
  console.log(`getVisibleTodos() was called ${++calls} times`);
  const activeTodos = todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
  const visibleTodos = showActive ? activeTodos : todos;
  return visibleTodos;
}

export function createTodo(text, completed = false) {
  return {
    id: nextId++,
    text,
    completed
  };
}

export const initialTodos = [
  createTodo('Get apples', true),
  createTodo('Get oranges', true),
  createTodo('Get carrots'),
];
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Remove the state variable and the Effect, and instead add a `useMemo` call to cache the result of calling `getVisibleTodos()`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { initialTodos, createTodo, getVisibleTodos } from './todos.js';

export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(initialTodos);
  const [showActive, setShowActive] = useState(false);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(
    () => getVisibleTodos(todos, showActive),
    [todos, showActive]
  );

  function handleAddClick() {
    setText('');
    setTodos([...todos, createTodo(text)]);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showActive}
          onChange={e => setShowActive(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Show only active todos
      </label>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleAddClick}>
        Add
      </button>
      <ul>
        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.completed ? <s>{todo.text}</s> : todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/todos.js
let nextId = 0;
let calls = 0;

export function getVisibleTodos(todos, showActive) {
  console.log(`getVisibleTodos() was called ${++calls} times`);
  const activeTodos = todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
  const visibleTodos = showActive ? activeTodos : todos;
  return visibleTodos;
}

export function createTodo(text, completed = false) {
  return {
    id: nextId++,
    text,
    completed
  };
}

export const initialTodos = [
  createTodo('Get apples', true),
  createTodo('Get oranges', true),
  createTodo('Get carrots'),
];
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

With this change, `getVisibleTodos()` will be called only if `todos` or `showActive` change. Typing into the input only changes the `text` state variable, so it does not trigger a call to `getVisibleTodos()`.

There is also another solution which does not need `useMemo`. Since the `text` state variable can't possibly affect the list of todos, you can extract the `NewTodo` form into a separate component, and move the `text` state variable inside of it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { initialTodos, createTodo, getVisibleTodos } from './todos.js';

export default function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(initialTodos);
  const [showActive, setShowActive] = useState(false);
  const visibleTodos = getVisibleTodos(todos, showActive);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showActive}
          onChange={e => setShowActive(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Show only active todos
      </label>
      <NewTodo onAdd={newTodo => setTodos([...todos, newTodo])} />
      <ul>
        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.completed ? <s>{todo.text}</s> : todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

function NewTodo({ onAdd }) {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  function handleAddClick() {
    setText('');
    onAdd(createTodo(text));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleAddClick}>
        Add
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/todos.js
let nextId = 0;
let calls = 0;

export function getVisibleTodos(todos, showActive) {
  console.log(`getVisibleTodos() was called ${++calls} times`);
  const activeTodos = todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
  const visibleTodos = showActive ? activeTodos : todos;
  return visibleTodos;
}

export function createTodo(text, completed = false) {
  return {
    id: nextId++,
    text,
    completed
  };
}

export const initialTodos = [
  createTodo('Get apples', true),
  createTodo('Get oranges', true),
  createTodo('Get carrots'),
];
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This approach satisfies the requirements too. When you type into the input, only the `text` state variable updates. Since the `text` state variable is in the child `NewTodo` component, the parent `TodoList` component won't get re-rendered. This is why `getVisibleTodos()` doesn't get called when you type. (It would still be called if the `TodoList` re-renders for another reason.)

</Solution>

#### Reset state without Effects {/*reset-state-without-effects*/}

This `EditContact` component receives a contact object shaped like `{ id, name, email }` as the `savedContact` prop. Try editing the name and email input fields. When you press Save, the contact's button above the form updates to the edited name. When you press Reset, any pending changes in the form are discarded. Play around with this UI to get a feel for it.

When you select a contact with the buttons at the top, the form resets to reflect that contact's details. This is done with an Effect inside `EditContact.js`. Remove this Effect. Find another way to reset the form when `savedContact.id` changes.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import ContactList from './ContactList.js';
import EditContact from './EditContact.js';

export default function ContactManager() {
  const [
    contacts,
    setContacts
  ] = useState(initialContacts);
  const [
    selectedId,
    setSelectedId
  ] = useState(0);
  const selectedContact = contacts.find(c =>
    c.id === selectedId
  );

  function handleSave(updatedData) {
    const nextContacts = contacts.map(c => {
      if (c.id === updatedData.id) {
        return updatedData;
      } else {
        return c;
      }
    });
    setContacts(nextContacts);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ContactList
        contacts={contacts}
        selectedId={selectedId}
        onSelect={id => setSelectedId(id)}
      />
      <hr />
      <EditContact
        savedContact={selectedContact}
        onSave={handleSave}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

const initialContacts = [
  { id: 0, name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' }
];
```

```js src/ContactList.js hidden
export default function ContactList({
  contacts,
  selectedId,
  onSelect
}) {
  return (
    <section>
      <ul>
        {contacts.map(contact =>
          <li key={contact.id}>
            <button onClick={() => {
              onSelect(contact.id);
            }}>

<Hint>

It would be nice if there was a way to tell React that when `savedContact.id` is different, the `EditContact` form is conceptually a _different contact's form_ and should not preserve state. Do you recall any such way?

</Hint>

<Solution>

Split the `EditContact` component in two. Move all the form state into the inner `EditForm` component. Export the outer `EditContact` component, and make it pass `savedContact.id` as the `key` to the inner `EditForm` component. As a result, the inner `EditForm` component resets all of the form state and recreates the DOM whenever you select a different contact.

#### Submit a form without Effects {/*submit-a-form-without-effects*/}

This `Form` component lets you send a message to a friend. When you submit the form, the `showForm` state variable is set to `false`. This triggers an Effect calling `sendMessage(message)`, which sends the message (you can see it in the console). After the message is sent, you see a "Thank you" dialog with an "Open chat" button that lets you get back to the form.

Your app's users are sending way too many messages. To make chatting a little bit more difficult, you've decided to show the "Thank you" dialog *first* rather than the form. Change the `showForm` state variable to initialize to `false` instead of `true`. As soon as you make that change, the console will show that an empty message was sent. Something in this logic is wrong!

What's the root cause of this problem? And how can you fix it?

<Hint>

Should the message be sent _because_ the user saw the "Thank you" dialog? Or is it the other way around?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(true);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!showForm) {
      sendMessage(message);
    }
  }, [showForm, message]);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setShowForm(false);
  }

  if (!showForm) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Thanks for using our services!</h1>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setMessage('');
          setShowForm(true);
        }}>
          Open chat
        </button>
      </>
    );
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit" disabled={message === ''}>
        Send
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}

function sendMessage(message) {
  console.log('Sending message: ' + message);
}
```

```css
label, textarea { margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The `showForm` state variable determines whether to show the form or the "Thank you" dialog. However, you aren't sending the message because the "Thank you" dialog was _displayed_. You want to send the message because the user has _submitted the form._ Delete the misleading Effect and move the `sendMessage` call inside the `handleSubmit` event handler:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(true);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setShowForm(false);
    sendMessage(message);
  }

  if (!showForm) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Thanks for using our services!</h1>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setMessage('');
          setShowForm(true);
        }}>
          Open chat
        </button>
      </>
    );
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit" disabled={message === ''}>
        Send
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}

function sendMessage(message) {
  console.log('Sending message: ' + message);
}
```

```css
label, textarea { margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice how in this version, only _submitting the form_ (which is an event) causes the message to be sent. It works equally well regardless of whether `showForm` is initially set to `true` or `false`. (Set it to `false` and notice no extra console messages.)

title: 'Lifecycle of Reactive Effects'
---

<Intro>

Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. React provides a linter rule to check that you've specified your Effect's dependencies correctly. This keeps your Effect synchronized to the latest props and state.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

- How an Effect's lifecycle is different from a component's lifecycle
- How to think about each individual Effect in isolation
- When your Effect needs to re-synchronize, and why
- How your Effect's dependencies are determined
- What it means for a value to be reactive
- What an empty dependency array means
- How React verifies your dependencies are correct with a linter
- What to do when you disagree with the linter

</YouWillLearn>

## The lifecycle of an Effect {/*the-lifecycle-of-an-effect*/}

Every React component goes through the same lifecycle:

- A component _mounts_ when it's added to the screen.
- A component _updates_ when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
- A component _unmounts_ when it's removed from the screen.

**It's a good way to think about components, but _not_ about Effects.** Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component's lifecycle. An Effect describes how to [synchronize an external system](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.

To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:

```js
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Your Effect's body specifies how to **start synchronizing:**

```js {2-3}
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
    // ...
```

The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to **stop synchronizing:**

```js {5}
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
    // ...
```

Intuitively, you might think that React would **start synchronizing** when your component mounts and **stop synchronizing** when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to **start and stop synchronizing multiple times** while the component remains mounted.

Let's look at _why_ this is necessary, _when_ it happens, and _how_ you can control this behavior.

<Note>

Some Effects don't return a cleanup function at all. [More often than not,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development) you'll want to return one--but if you don't, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function.

</Note>

### Why synchronization may need to happen more than once {/*why-synchronization-may-need-to-happen-more-than-once*/}

Imagine this `ChatRoom` component receives a `roomId` prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let's say that initially the user picks the `"general"` room as the `roomId`. Your app displays the `"general"` chat room:

```js {3}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {
  // ...
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

After the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to **start synchronizing.** It connects to the `"general"` room:

```js {3,4}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "general" room
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the "general" room
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
```

So far, so good.

Later, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, `"travel"`). First, React will update the UI:

```js {1}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "travel" */ }) {
  // ...
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

Think about what should happen next. The user sees that `"travel"` is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the `"general"` room. **The `roomId` prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the `"general"` room) no longer matches the UI.**

At this point, you want React to do two things:

1. Stop synchronizing with the old `roomId` (disconnect from the `"general"` room)
2. Start synchronizing with the new `roomId` (connect to the `"travel"` room)

**Luckily, you've already taught React how to do both of these things!** Your Effect's body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let's see how exactly that happens.

### How React re-synchronizes your Effect {/*how-react-re-synchronizes-your-effect*/}

Recall that your `ChatRoom` component has received a new value for its `roomId` prop. It used to be `"general"`, and now it is `"travel"`. React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room.

To **stop synchronizing,** React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the `"general"` room. Since `roomId` was `"general"`, the cleanup function disconnects from the `"general"` room:

```js {6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "general" room
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the "general" room
    };
    // ...
```

Then React will run the Effect that you've provided during this render. This time, `roomId` is `"travel"` so it will **start synchronizing** to the `"travel"` chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too):

```js {3,4}
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "travel" */ }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "travel" room
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

Thanks to this, you're now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted!

Every time after your component re-renders with a different `roomId`, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let's say the user changes `roomId` from `"travel"` to `"music"`. React will again **stop synchronizing** your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the `"travel"` room). Then it will **start synchronizing** again by running its body with the new `roomId` prop (connecting you to the `"music"` room).

Finally, when the user goes to a different screen, `ChatRoom` unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will **stop synchronizing** your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the `"music"` chat room.

### Thinking from the Effect's perspective {/*thinking-from-the-effects-perspective*/}

Let's recap everything that's happened from the `ChatRoom` component's perspective:

1. `ChatRoom` mounted with `roomId` set to `"general"`
1. `ChatRoom` updated with `roomId` set to `"travel"`
1. `ChatRoom` updated with `roomId` set to `"music"`
1. `ChatRoom` unmounted

During each of these points in the component's lifecycle, your Effect did different things:

1. Your Effect connected to the `"general"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"general"` room and connected to the `"travel"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"travel"` room and connected to the `"music"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"music"` room

Now let's think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself:

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // Your Effect connected to the room specified with roomId...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      // ...until it disconnected
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
```

This code's structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods:

1. Your Effect connected to the `"general"` room (until it disconnected)
1. Your Effect connected to the `"travel"` room (until it disconnected)
1. Your Effect connected to the `"music"` room (until it disconnected)

Previously, you were thinking from the component's perspective. When you looked from the component's perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as "callbacks" or "lifecycle events" that fire at a specific time like "after a render" or "before unmount". This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it's best to avoid.

**Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn't matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it's needed.**

This might remind you how you don't think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React [figures out the rest.](/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state)

### How React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize {/*how-react-verifies-that-your-effect-can-re-synchronize*/}

Here is a live example that you can play with. Press "Open chat" to mount the `ChatRoom` component:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice that when the component mounts for the first time, you see three logs:

1. `✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...` *(development-only)*
1. `❌ Disconnected from "general" room at https://localhost:1234.` *(development-only)*
1. `✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...`

The first two logs are development-only. In development, React always remounts each component once.

**React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development.** This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check [you've implemented its cleanup well.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

The main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the `roomId` changes, your Effect re-synchronizes.

However, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the `serverUrl` in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization.

### How React knows that it needs to re-synchronize the Effect {/*how-react-knows-that-it-needs-to-re-synchronize-the-effect*/}

You might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after `roomId` changes. It's because *you told React* that its code depends on `roomId` by including it in the [list of dependencies:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies)

```js {1,3,8}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // The roomId prop may change over time
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads roomId 
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" roomId
  // ...
```

Here's how this works:

1. You knew `roomId` is a prop, which means it can change over time.
2. You knew that your Effect reads `roomId` (so its logic depends on a value that may change later).
3. This is why you specified it as your Effect's dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when `roomId` changes).

Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect.

For example, if you passed `["general"]` during the initial render, and later you passed `["travel"]` during the next render, React will compare `"general"` and `"travel"`. These are different values (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but `roomId` has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.

### Each Effect represents a separate synchronization process {/*each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process*/}

Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let's say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on `roomId`, so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there:

```js {3}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(roomId);
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

But imagine you later add another dependency to this Effect that needs to re-establish the connection. If this Effect re-synchronizes, it will also call `logVisit(roomId)` for the same room, which you did not intend. Logging the visit **is a separate process** from connecting. Write them as two separate Effects:

```js {2-4}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(roomId);
  }, [roomId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    // ...
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

**Each Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process.**

In the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn’t break the other Effect's logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you split up a cohesive piece of logic into separate Effects, the code may look "cleaner" but will be [more difficult to maintain.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#chains-of-computations) This is why you should think whether the processes are same or separate, not whether the code looks cleaner.

## Effects "react" to reactive values {/*effects-react-to-reactive-values*/}

Your Effect reads two variables (`serverUrl` and `roomId`), but you only specified `roomId` as a dependency:

```js {5,10}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Why doesn't `serverUrl` need to be a dependency?

This is because the `serverUrl` never changes due to a re-render. It's always the same no matter how many times the component re-renders and why. Since `serverUrl` never changes, it wouldn't make sense to specify it as a dependency. After all, dependencies only do something when they change over time!

On the other hand, `roomId` may be different on a re-render. **Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are _reactive_ because they're calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.**

If `serverUrl` was a state variable, it would be reactive. Reactive values must be included in dependencies:

```js {2,5,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // Props change over time
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // State may change over time

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads props and state
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" on props and state
  // ...
}
```

By including `serverUrl` as a dependency, you ensure that the Effect re-synchronizes after it changes.

Try changing the selected chat room or edit the server URL in this sandbox:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:{' '}
        <input
          value={serverUrl}
          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Whenever you change a reactive value like `roomId` or `serverUrl`, the Effect re-connects to the chat server.

### What an Effect with empty dependencies means {/*what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means*/}

What happens if you move both `serverUrl` and `roomId` outside the component?

```js {1,2}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'general';

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now your Effect's code does not use *any* reactive values, so its dependencies can be empty (`[]`).

Thinking from the component's perspective, the empty `[]` dependency array means this Effect connects to the chat room only when the component mounts, and disconnects only when the component unmounts. (Keep in mind that React would still [re-synchronize it an extra time](#how-react-verifies-that-your-effect-can-re-synchronize) in development to stress-test your logic.)


<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'general';

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <ChatRoom />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

However, if you [think from the Effect's perspective,](#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective) you don't need to think about mounting and unmounting at all. What's important is you've specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change `roomId` or `serverUrl` over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect's code won't change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies.

### All variables declared in the component body are reactive {/*all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive*/}

Props and state aren't the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.

Let's say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you've already put the settings state in a [context](/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) so you read the `settings` from that context. Now you calculate the `serverUrl` based on the selected server from props and the default server:

```js {3,5,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, selectedServerUrl }) { // roomId is reactive
  const settings = useContext(SettingsContext); // settings is reactive
  const serverUrl = selectedServerUrl ?? settings.defaultServerUrl; // serverUrl is reactive
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads roomId and serverUrl
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So it needs to re-synchronize when either of them changes!
  // ...
}
```

In this example, `serverUrl` is not a prop or a state variable. It's a regular variable that you calculate during rendering. But it's calculated during rendering, so it can change due to a re-render. This is why it's reactive.

**All values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component's body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect's dependencies.**

In other words, Effects "react" to all values from the component body.

<DeepDive>

#### Can global or mutable values be dependencies? {/*can-global-or-mutable-values-be-dependencies*/}

Mutable values (including global variables) aren't reactive.

**A mutable value like [`location.pathname`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/pathname) can't be a dependency.** It's mutable, so it can change at any time completely outside of the React rendering data flow. Changing it wouldn't trigger a re-render of your component. Therefore, even if you specified it in the dependencies, React *wouldn't know* to re-synchronize the Effect when it changes. This also breaks the rules of React because reading mutable data during rendering (which is when you calculate the dependencies) breaks [purity of rendering.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Instead, you should read and subscribe to an external mutable value with [`useSyncExternalStore`.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#subscribing-to-an-external-store)

**A mutable value like [`ref.current`](/reference/react/useRef#reference) or things you read from it also can't be a dependency.** The ref object returned by `useRef` itself can be a dependency, but its `current` property is intentionally mutable. It lets you [keep track of something without triggering a re-render.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) But since changing it doesn't trigger a re-render, it's not a reactive value, and React won't know to re-run your Effect when it changes.

As you'll learn below on this page, a linter will check for these issues automatically.

</DeepDive>

### React verifies that you specified every reactive value as a dependency {/*react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency*/}

If your linter is [configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) it will check that every reactive value used by your Effect's code is declared as its dependency. For example, this is a lint error because both `roomId` and `serverUrl` are reactive:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // roomId is reactive
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // <-- Something's wrong here!

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:{' '}
        <input
          value={serverUrl}
          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This may look like a React error, but really React is pointing out a bug in your code. Both `roomId` and `serverUrl` may change over time, but you're forgetting to re-synchronize your Effect when they change. You will remain connected to the initial `roomId` and `serverUrl` even after the user picks different values in the UI.

To fix the bug, follow the linter's suggestion to specify `roomId` and `serverUrl` as dependencies of your Effect:

```js {9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // roomId is reactive
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Try this fix in the sandbox above. Verify that the linter error is gone, and the chat re-connects when needed.

<Note>

In some cases, React *knows* that a value never changes even though it's declared inside the component. For example, the [`set` function](/reference/react/useState#setstate) returned from `useState` and the ref object returned by [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef) are *stable*--they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render. Stable values aren't reactive, so you may omit them from the list. Including them is allowed: they won't change, so it doesn't matter.

</Note>

### What to do when you don't want to re-synchronize {/*what-to-do-when-you-dont-want-to-re-synchronize*/}

In the previous example, you've fixed the lint error by listing `roomId` and `serverUrl` as dependencies.

**However, you could instead "prove" to the linter that these values aren't reactive values,** i.e. that they *can't* change as a result of a re-render. For example, if `serverUrl` and `roomId` don't depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don't need to be dependencies:

```js {1,2,11}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

You can also move them *inside the Effect.* They aren't calculated during rendering, so they're not reactive:

```js {3,4,10}
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
    const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

**Effects are reactive blocks of code.** They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.

**You can't "choose" your dependencies.** Your dependencies must include every [reactive value](#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive) you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don't fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here's what to try instead:

* **Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process.** If your Effect doesn't synchronize anything, [it might be unnecessary.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) If it synchronizes several independent things, [split it up.](#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process)

* **If you want to read the latest value of props or state without "reacting" to it and re-synchronizing the Effect,** you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you'll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you'll extract into something called an _Effect Event_). [Read about separating Events from Effects.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects)

* **Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies.** If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. [Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

<Pitfall>

The linter is your friend, but its powers are limited. The linter only knows when the dependencies are *wrong*. It doesn't know *the best* way to solve each case. If the linter suggests a dependency, but adding it causes a loop, it doesn't mean the linter should be ignored. You need to change the code inside (or outside) the Effect so that that value isn't reactive and doesn't *need* to be a dependency.

If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:

```js {3-4}
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:
  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);
```

On the [next](/learn/separating-events-from-effects) [pages](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies), you'll learn how to fix this code without breaking the rules. It's always worth fixing!

</Pitfall>

<Recap>

- Components can mount, update, and unmount.
- Each Effect has a separate lifecycle from the surrounding component.
- Each Effect describes a separate synchronization process that can *start* and *stop*.
- When you write and read Effects, think from each individual Effect's perspective (how to start and stop synchronization) rather than from the component's perspective (how it mounts, updates, or unmounts).
- Values declared inside the component body are "reactive".
- Reactive values should re-synchronize the Effect because they can change over time.
- The linter verifies that all reactive values used inside the Effect are specified as dependencies.
- All errors flagged by the linter are legitimate. There's always a way to fix the code to not break the rules.

#### Fix reconnecting on every keystroke {/*fix-reconnecting-on-every-keystroke*/}

In this example, the `ChatRoom` component connects to the chat room when the component mounts, disconnects when it unmounts, and reconnects when you select a different chat room. This behavior is correct, so you need to keep it working.

However, there is a problem. Whenever you type into the message box input at the bottom, `ChatRoom` *also* reconnects to the chat. (You can notice this by clearing the console and typing into the input.) Fix the issue so that this doesn't happen.

<Hint>

You might need to add a dependency array for this Effect. What dependencies should be there?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  });

  };

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

This Effect didn't have a dependency array at all, so it re-synchronized after every re-render. First, add a dependency array. Then, make sure that every reactive value used by the Effect is specified in the array. For example, `roomId` is reactive (because it's a prop), so it should be included in the array. This ensures that when the user selects a different room, the chat reconnects. On the other hand, `serverUrl` is defined outside the component. This is why it doesn't need to be in the array.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
      <input
        value={message}

#### Switch synchronization on and off {/*switch-synchronization-on-and-off*/}

In this example, an Effect subscribes to the window [`pointermove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointermove_event) event to move a pink dot on the screen. Try hovering over the preview area (or touching the screen if you're on a mobile device), and see how the pink dot follows your movement.

There is also a checkbox. Ticking the checkbox toggles the `canMove` state variable, but this state variable is not used anywhere in the code. Your task is to change the code so that when `canMove` is `false` (the checkbox is ticked off), the dot should stop moving. After you toggle the checkbox back on (and set `canMove` to `true`), the box should follow the movement again. In other words, whether the dot can move or not should stay synchronized to whether the checkbox is checked.

<Hint>

You can't declare an Effect conditionally. However, the code inside the Effect can use conditions!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });

One solution is to wrap the `setPosition` call into an `if (canMove) { ... }` condition:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      if (canMove) {
        setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
      }
    }
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, [canMove]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)} 
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Alternatively, you could wrap the *event subscription* logic into an `if (canMove) { ... }` condition:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
    if (canMove) {
      window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
      return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    }
  }, [canMove]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)} 
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In both of these cases, `canMove` is a reactive variable that you read inside the Effect. This is why it must be specified in the list of Effect dependencies. This ensures that the Effect re-synchronizes after every change to its value.

</Solution>

#### Investigate a stale value bug {/*investigate-a-stale-value-bug*/}

In this example, the pink dot should move when the checkbox is on, and should stop moving when the checkbox is off. The logic for this has already been implemented: the `handleMove` event handler checks the `canMove` state variable.

However, for some reason, the `canMove` state variable inside `handleMove` appears to be "stale": it's always `true`, even after you tick off the checkbox. How is this possible? Find the mistake in the code and fix it.

If you see a linter rule being suppressed, remove the suppression! That's where the mistakes usually are.

<Solution>

The problem with the original code was suppressing the dependency linter. If you remove the suppression, you'll see that this Effect depends on the `handleMove` function. This makes sense: `handleMove` is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!

The author of the original code has "lied" to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (`[]`) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after `canMove` has changed (and `handleMove` with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the `handleMove` attached as a listener is the `handleMove` function created during the initial render. During the initial render, `canMove` was `true`, which is why `handleMove` from the initial render will forever see that value.

**If you never suppress the linter, you will never see problems with stale values.** There are a few different ways to solve this bug, but you should always start by removing the linter suppression. Then change the code to fix the lint error.

You can change the Effect dependencies to `[handleMove]`, but since it's going to be a newly defined function for every render, you might as well remove dependencies array altogether. Then the Effect *will* re-synchronize after every re-render:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  function handleMove(e) {
    if (canMove) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)} 
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

This solution works, but it's not ideal. If you put `console.log('Resubscribing')` inside the Effect, you'll notice that it resubscribes after every re-render. Resubscribing is fast, but it would still be nice to avoid doing it so often.

A better fix would be to move the `handleMove` function *inside* the Effect. Then `handleMove` won't be a reactive value, and so your Effect won't depend on a function. Instead, it will need to depend on `canMove` which your code now reads from inside the Effect. This matches the behavior you wanted, since your Effect will now stay synchronized with the value of `canMove`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      if (canMove) {
        setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
      }
    }

    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, [canMove]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)} 
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try adding `console.log('Resubscribing')` inside the Effect body and notice that now it only resubscribes when you toggle the checkbox (`canMove` changes) or edit the code. This makes it better than the previous approach that always resubscribed.

#### Fix a connection switch {/*fix-a-connection-switch*/}

In this example, the chat service in `chat.js` exposes two different APIs: `createEncryptedConnection` and `createUnencryptedConnection`. The root `App` component lets the user choose whether to use encryption or not, and then passes down the corresponding API method to the child `ChatRoom` component as the `createConnection` prop.

Notice that initially, the console logs say the connection is not encrypted. Try toggling the checkbox on: nothing will happen. However, if you change the selected room after that, then the chat will reconnect *and* enable encryption (as you'll see from the console messages). This is a bug. Fix the bug so that toggling the checkbox *also* causes the chat to reconnect.

<Hint>

Suppressing the linter is always suspicious. Could this be a bug?

<Solution>

If you remove the linter suppression, you will see a lint error. The problem is that `createConnection` is a prop, so it's a reactive value. It can change over time! (And indeed, it should--when the user ticks the checkbox, the parent component passes a different value of the `createConnection` prop.) This is why it should be a dependency. Include it in the list to fix the bug:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';
import {
  createEncryptedConnection,
  createUnencryptedConnection,
} from './chat.js';

  const [isEncrypted, setIsEncrypted] = useState(false);

  }, [roomId, createConnection]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js

  };

</Sandpack>

It is correct that `createConnection` is a dependency. However, this code is a bit fragile because someone could edit the `App` component to pass an inline function as the value of this prop. In that case, its value would be different every time the `App` component re-renders, so the Effect might re-synchronize too often. To avoid this, you can pass `isEncrypted` down instead:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [isEncrypted, setIsEncrypted] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isEncrypted}
          onChange={e => setIsEncrypted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Enable encryption
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
        isEncrypted={isEncrypted}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/ChatRoom.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import {
  createEncryptedConnection,
  createUnencryptedConnection,
} from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, isEncrypted }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const createConnection = isEncrypted ?
      createEncryptedConnection :
      createUnencryptedConnection;
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, isEncrypted]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createEncryptedConnection(roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {

    },
    disconnect() {

</Sandpack>

In this version, the `App` component passes a boolean prop instead of a function. Inside the Effect, you decide which function to use. Since both `createEncryptedConnection` and `createUnencryptedConnection` are declared outside the component, they aren't reactive, and don't need to be dependencies. You'll learn more about this in [Removing Effect Dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

#### Populate a chain of select boxes {/*populate-a-chain-of-select-boxes*/}

In this example, there are two select boxes. One select box lets the user pick a planet. Another select box lets the user pick a place *on that planet.* The second box doesn't work yet. Your task is to make it show the places on the chosen planet.

Look at how the first select box works. It populates the `planetList` state with the result from the `"/planets"` API call. The currently selected planet's ID is kept in the `planetId` state variable. You need to find where to add some additional code so that the `placeList` state variable is populated with the result of the `"/planets/" + planetId + "/places"` API call.

If you implement this right, selecting a planet should populate the place list. Changing a planet should change the place list.

If you have two independent synchronization processes, you need to write two separate Effects.

There are two independent synchronization processes:

- The first select box is synchronized to the remote list of planets.
- The second select box is synchronized to the remote list of places for the current `planetId`.

This is why it makes sense to describe them as two separate Effects. Here's an example of how you could do this:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchData } from './api.js';

export default function Page() {
  const [planetList, setPlanetList] = useState([])
  const [planetId, setPlanetId] = useState('');

  const [placeList, setPlaceList] = useState([]);
  const [placeId, setPlaceId] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetchData('/planets').then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        console.log('Fetched a list of planets.');
        setPlanetList(result);
        setPlanetId(result[0].id); // Select the first planet
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (planetId === '') {
      // Nothing is selected in the first box yet
      return;
    }

    let ignore = false;
    fetchData('/planets/' + planetId + '/places').then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        console.log('Fetched a list of places on "' + planetId + '".');
        setPlaceList(result);
        setPlaceId(result[0].id); // Select the first place
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, [planetId]);

  return (

This code is a bit repetitive. However, that's not a good reason to combine it into a single Effect! If you did this, you'd have to combine both Effect's dependencies into one list, and then changing the planet would refetch the list of all planets. Effects are not a tool for code reuse.

Instead, to reduce repetition, you can extract some logic into a custom Hook like `useSelectOptions` below:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useSelectOptions } from './useSelectOptions.js';

export default function Page() {
  const [
    planetList,
    planetId,
    setPlanetId
  ] = useSelectOptions('/planets');

  const [
    placeList,
    placeId,
    setPlaceId
  ] = useSelectOptions(planetId ? `/planets/${planetId}/places` : null);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Pick a planet:{' '}
        <select value={planetId} onChange={e => {
          setPlanetId(e.target.value);
        }}>
          {planetList?.map(planet =>
            <option key={planet.id} value={planet.id}>{planet.name}</option>
          )}
        </select>
      </label>
      <label>
        Pick a place:{' '}
        <select value={placeId} onChange={e => {
          setPlaceId(e.target.value);
        }}>
          {placeList?.map(place =>
            <option key={place.id} value={place.id}>{place.name}</option>
          )}
        </select>
      </label>

    </>
  );
}

Check the `useSelectOptions.js` tab in the sandbox to see how it works. Ideally, most Effects in your application should eventually be replaced by custom Hooks, whether written by you or by the community. Custom Hooks hide the synchronization logic, so the calling component doesn't know about the Effect. As you keep working on your app, you'll develop a palette of Hooks to choose from, and eventually you won't need to write Effects in your components very often.

title: 'Separating Events from Effects'
---

<Intro>

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read, like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during the last render. Sometimes, you also want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. This page will teach you how to do that.

</Intro>

- Why Effects are reactive, and event handlers are not
- What to do when you want a part of your Effect's code to not be reactive
- What Effect Events are, and how to extract them from your Effects
- How to read the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events

</YouWillLearn>

## Choosing between event handlers and Effects {/*choosing-between-event-handlers-and-effects*/}

First, let's recap the difference between event handlers and Effects.

Imagine you're implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this:

1. Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat room.
1. When you click the "Send" button, it should send a message to the chat.

Let's say you've already implemented the code for them, but you're not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider [*why* the code needs to run.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events)

### Event handlers run in response to specific interactions {/*event-handlers-run-in-response-to-specific-interactions*/}

From the user's perspective, sending a message should happen *because* the particular "Send" button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions:

```js {4-6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  // ...
  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

With an event handler, you can be sure that `sendMessage(message)` will *only* run if the user presses the button.

### Effects run whenever synchronization is needed {/*effects-run-whenever-synchronization-is-needed*/}

Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go?

The *reason* to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn't matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they're looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would *still* need to connect. This is why it's an Effect:

```js {3-9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, *regardless* of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect ensures that the component will *remain synchronized* with the currently selected room, and will [re-connect whenever it's necessary.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#why-synchronization-may-need-to-happen-more-than-once)

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function sendMessage(message) {
  console.log('🔵 You sent: ' + message);
}

export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input, select { margin-right: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

## Reactive values and reactive logic {/*reactive-values-and-reactive-logic*/}

Intuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered "manually", for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other hand, are "automatic": they run and re-run as often as it's needed to stay synchronized.

There is a more precise way to think about this.

Props, state, and variables declared inside your component's body are called <CodeStep step={2}>reactive values</CodeStep>. In this example, `serverUrl` is not a reactive value, but `roomId` and `message` are. They participate in the rendering data flow:

```js [[2, 3, "roomId"], [2, 4, "message"]]
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  // ...
}
```

Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the `message` or choose a different `roomId` in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes differently:

- **Logic inside event handlers is *not reactive.*** It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (e.g. a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values without "reacting" to their changes.
- **Logic inside Effects is *reactive.*** If your Effect reads a reactive value, [you have to specify it as a dependency.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect's logic with the new value.

Let's revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.

### Logic inside event handlers is not reactive {/*logic-inside-event-handlers-is-not-reactive*/}

Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?

```js [[2, 2, "message"]]
    // ...
    sendMessage(message);
    // ...
```

From the user's perspective, **a change to the `message` does _not_ mean that they want to send a message.** It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep> has changed. That's why it belongs in the event handler:

```js {2}
  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
```

Event handlers aren't reactive, so `sendMessage(message)` will only run when the user clicks the Send button.

### Logic inside Effects is reactive {/*logic-inside-effects-is-reactive*/}

Now let's return to these lines:

```js [[2, 2, "roomId"]]
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

From the user's perspective, **a change to the `roomId` *does* mean that they want to connect to a different room.** In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You *want* these lines of code to "keep up" with the <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep>, and to run again if that value is different. That's why it belongs in an Effect:

```js {2-3}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    };
  }, [roomId]);
```

Effects are reactive, so `createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)` and `connection.connect()` will run for every distinct value of `roomId`. Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room.

## Extracting non-reactive logic out of Effects {/*extracting-non-reactive-logic-out-of-effects*/}

Things get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with non-reactive logic.

For example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color:

```js {1,4-6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

However, `theme` is a reactive value (it can change as a result of re-rendering), and [every reactive value read by an Effect must be declared as its dependency.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) Now you have to specify `theme` as a dependency of your Effect:

```js {5,11}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    };
  }, [roomId, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Play with this example and see if you can spot the problem with this user experience:

<Sandpack>

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, theme]);

          onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Use dark theme
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
        theme={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  let connectedCallback;
  let timeout;
  return {
    connect() {
      timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        if (connectedCallback) {
          connectedCallback();
        }
      }, 100);
    },
    on(event, callback) {
      if (connectedCallback) {
        throw Error('Cannot add the handler twice.');
      }
      if (event !== 'connected') {
        throw Error('Only "connected" event is supported.');
      }
      connectedCallback = callback;
    },
    disconnect() {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    }
  };
}
```

```js src/notifications.js
import Toastify from 'toastify-js';
import 'toastify-js/src/toastify.css';

export function showNotification(message, theme) {
  Toastify({
    text: message,
    duration: 2000,
    gravity: 'top',
    position: 'right',
    style: {
      background: theme === 'dark' ? 'black' : 'white',
      color: theme === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'black',
    },
  }).showToast();
}
```

```css
label { display: block; margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

When the `roomId` changes, the chat re-connects as you would expect. But since `theme` is also a dependency, the chat *also* re-connects every time you switch between the dark and the light theme. That's not great!

In other words, you *don't* want this line to be reactive, even though it is inside an Effect (which is reactive):

```js
      // ...
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
      // ...
```

You need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive Effect around it.

### Declaring an Effect Event {/*declaring-an-effect-event*/}

Use a special Hook called [`useEffectEvent`](/reference/react/useEffectEvent) to extract this non-reactive logic out of your Effect:

```js {1,4-6}
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });
  // ...
```

Here, `onConnected` is called an *Effect Event.* It's a part of your Effect logic, but it behaves a lot more like an event handler. The logic inside it is not reactive, and it always "sees" the latest values of your props and state.

Now you can call the `onConnected` Effect Event from inside your Effect:

```js {2-4,9,13}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This solves the problem. Note that you had to *remove* `theme` from the list of your Effect's dependencies, because it's no longer used in the Effect. You also don't need to *add* `onConnected` to it, because **Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies.**

Verify that the new behavior works as you would expect:

You can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers. The main difference is that event handlers run in response to user interactions, whereas Effect Events are triggered by you from Effects. Effect Events let you "break the chain" between the reactivity of Effects and code that should not be reactive.

### Reading latest props and state with Effect Events {/*reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events*/}

Effect Events let you fix many patterns where you might be tempted to suppress the dependency linter.

For example, say you have an Effect to log the page visits:

```js
function Page() {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

Later, you add multiple routes to your site. Now your `Page` component receives a `url` prop with the current path. You want to pass the `url` as a part of your `logVisit` call, but the dependency linter complains:

```js {1,3}
function Page({ url }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url);
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'
  // ...
}
```

Think about what you want the code to do. You *want* to log a separate visit for different URLs since each URL represents a different page. In other words, this `logVisit` call *should* be reactive with respect to the `url`. This is why, in this case, it makes sense to follow the dependency linter, and add `url` as a dependency:

```js {4}
function Page({ url }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now let's say you want to include the number of items in the shopping cart together with every page visit:

```js {2-3,6}
function Page({ url }) {
  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);
  }, [url]); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'numberOfItems'
  // ...
}
```

You used `numberOfItems` inside the Effect, so the linter asks you to add it as a dependency. However, you *don't* want the `logVisit` call to be reactive with respect to `numberOfItems`. If the user puts something into the shopping cart, and the `numberOfItems` changes, this *does not mean* that the user visited the page again. In other words, *visiting the page* is, in some sense, an "event". It happens at a precise moment in time.

Split the code in two parts:

```js {5-7,10}
function Page({ url }) {
  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Here, `onVisit` is an Effect Event. The code inside it isn't reactive. This is why you can use `numberOfItems` (or any other reactive value!) without worrying that it will cause the surrounding code to re-execute on changes.

On the other hand, the Effect itself remains reactive. Code inside the Effect uses the `url` prop, so the Effect will re-run after every re-render with a different `url`. This, in turn, will call the `onVisit` Effect Event.

As a result, you will call `logVisit` for every change to the `url`, and always read the latest `numberOfItems`. However, if `numberOfItems` changes on its own, this will not cause any of the code to re-run.

<Note>

You might be wondering if you could call `onVisit()` with no arguments, and read the `url` inside it:

```js {2,6}
  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(() => {
    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit();
  }, [url]);
```

This would work, but it's better to pass this `url` to the Effect Event explicitly. **By passing `url` as an argument to your Effect Event, you are saying that visiting a page with a different `url` constitutes a separate "event" from the user's perspective.** The `visitedUrl` is a *part* of the "event" that happened:

```js {1-2,6}
  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(url);
  }, [url]);
```

Since your Effect Event explicitly "asks" for the `visitedUrl`, now you can't accidentally remove `url` from the Effect's dependencies. If you remove the `url` dependency (causing distinct page visits to be counted as one), the linter will warn you about it. You want `onVisit` to be reactive with regards to the `url`, so instead of reading the `url` inside (where it wouldn't be reactive), you pass it *from* your Effect.

This becomes especially important if there is some asynchronous logic inside the Effect:

```js {6,8}
  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      onVisit(url);
    }, 5000); // Delay logging visits
  }, [url]);
```

Here, `url` inside `onVisit` corresponds to the *latest* `url` (which could have already changed), but `visitedUrl` corresponds to the `url` that originally caused this Effect (and this `onVisit` call) to run.

</Note>

#### Is it okay to suppress the dependency linter instead? {/*is-it-okay-to-suppress-the-dependency-linter-instead*/}

In the existing codebases, you may sometimes see the lint rule suppressed like this:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [8]}} {7-9}
function Page({ url }) {
  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);
  const numberOfItems = items.length;

  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url, numberOfItems);
    // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [url]);
  // ...
}
```

We recommend **never suppressing the linter**.

The first downside of suppressing the rule is that React will no longer warn you when your Effect needs to "react" to a new reactive dependency you've introduced to your code. In the earlier example, you added `url` to the dependencies *because* React reminded you to do it. You will no longer get such reminders for any future edits to that Effect if you disable the linter. This leads to bugs.

Here is an example of a confusing bug caused by suppressing the linter. In this example, the `handleMove` function is supposed to read the current `canMove` state variable value in order to decide whether the dot should follow the cursor. However, `canMove` is always `true` inside `handleMove`.

Can you see why?

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  function handleMove(e) {
    if (canMove) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)}
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>


The problem with this code is in suppressing the dependency linter. If you remove the suppression, you'll see that this Effect should depend on the `handleMove` function. This makes sense: `handleMove` is declared inside the component body, which makes it a reactive value. Every reactive value must be specified as a dependency, or it can potentially get stale over time!

The author of the original code has "lied" to React by saying that the Effect does not depend (`[]`) on any reactive values. This is why React did not re-synchronize the Effect after `canMove` has changed (and `handleMove` with it). Because React did not re-synchronize the Effect, the `handleMove` attached as a listener is the `handleMove` function created during the initial render. During the initial render, `canMove` was `true`, which is why `handleMove` from the initial render will forever see that value.

**If you never suppress the linter, you will never see problems with stale values.**

With `useEffectEvent`, there is no need to "lie" to the linter, and the code works as you would expect:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [canMove, setCanMove] = useState(true);

  const onMove = useEffectEvent(e => {
    if (canMove) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', onMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', onMove);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox"
          checked={canMove}
          onChange={e => setCanMove(e.target.checked)}
        />
        The dot is allowed to move
      </label>
      <hr />
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'pink',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        opacity: 0.6,
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        pointerEvents: 'none',
        left: -20,
        top: -20,
        width: 40,
        height: 40,
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  height: 200px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

This doesn't mean that `useEffectEvent` is *always* the correct solution. You should only apply it to the lines of code that you don't want to be reactive. In the above sandbox, you didn't want the Effect's code to be reactive with regards to `canMove`. That's why it made sense to extract an Effect Event.

Read [Removing Effect Dependencies](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) for other correct alternatives to suppressing the linter.

</DeepDive>

### Limitations of Effect Events {/*limitations-of-effect-events*/}

Effect Events are very limited in how you can use them:

* **Only call them from inside Effects.**
* **Never pass them to other components or Hooks.**

For example, don't declare and pass an Effect Event like this:

```js {4-6,8}
function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  });

  useTimer(onTick, 1000); // 🔴 Avoid: Passing Effect Events

  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}

function useTimer(callback, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      callback();
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay, callback]); // Need to specify "callback" in dependencies
}
```

Instead, always declare Effect Events directly next to the Effects that use them:

```js {10-12,16,21}
function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useTimer(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, 1000);
  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}

function useTimer(callback, delay) {
  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    callback();
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick(); // ✅ Good: Only called locally inside an Effect
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay]); // No need to specify "onTick" (an Effect Event) as a dependency
}
```

Effect Events are non-reactive "pieces" of your Effect code. They should be next to the Effect using them.

<Recap>

- Event handlers run in response to specific interactions.
- Effects run whenever synchronization is needed.
- Logic inside event handlers is not reactive.
- Logic inside Effects is reactive.
- You can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effect Events.
- Only call Effect Events from inside Effects.
- Don't pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.

#### Fix a variable that doesn't update {/*fix-a-variable-that-doesnt-update*/}

This `Timer` component keeps a `count` state variable which increases every second. The value by which it's increasing is stored in the `increment` state variable. You can control the `increment` variable with the plus and minus buttons.

However, no matter how many times you click the plus button, the counter is still incremented by one every second. What's wrong with this code? Why is `increment` always equal to `1` inside the Effect's code? Find the mistake and fix it.

<Hint>

To fix this code, it's enough to follow the rules.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [14]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + increment);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

As usual, when you're looking for bugs in Effects, start by searching for linter suppressions.

If you remove the suppression comment, React will tell you that this Effect's code depends on `increment`, but you "lied" to React by claiming that this Effect does not depend on any reactive values (`[]`). Add `increment` to the dependency array:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + increment);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [increment]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Now, when `increment` changes, React will re-synchronize your Effect, which will restart the interval.

</Solution>

#### Fix a freezing counter {/*fix-a-freezing-counter*/}

This `Timer` component keeps a `count` state variable which increases every second. The value by which it's increasing is stored in the `increment` state variable, which you can control it with the plus and minus buttons. For example, try pressing the plus button nine times, and notice that the `count` now increases each second by ten rather than by one.

There is a small issue with this user interface. You might notice that if you keep pressing the plus or minus buttons faster than once per second, the timer itself seems to pause. It only resumes after a second passes since the last time you've pressed either button. Find why this is happening, and fix the issue so that the timer ticks on *every* second without interruptions.

<Hint>

It seems like the Effect which sets up the timer "reacts" to the `increment` value. Does the line that uses the current `increment` value in order to call `setCount` really need to be reactive?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + increment);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [increment]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />

        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {

        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The issue is that the code inside the Effect uses the `increment` state variable. Since it's a dependency of your Effect, every change to `increment` causes the Effect to re-synchronize, which causes the interval to clear. If you keep clearing the interval every time before it has a chance to fire, it will appear as if the timer has stalled.

To solve the issue, extract an `onTick` Effect Event from the Effect:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(c => c + increment);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick();
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```


```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Since `onTick` is an Effect Event, the code inside it isn't reactive. The change to `increment` does not trigger any Effects.

</Solution>

#### Fix a non-adjustable delay {/*fix-a-non-adjustable-delay*/}

In this example, you can customize the interval delay. It's stored in a `delay` state variable which is updated by two buttons. However, even if you press the "plus 100 ms" button until the `delay` is 1000 milliseconds (that is, a second), you'll notice that the timer still increments very fast (every 100 ms). It's as if your changes to the `delay` are ignored. Find and fix the bug.

<Hint>

Code inside Effect Events is not reactive. Are there cases in which you would _want_ the `setInterval` call to re-run?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(100);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(c => c + increment);
  });

  const onMount = useEffectEvent(() => {
    return setInterval(() => {
      onTick();
    }, delay);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = onMount();
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);

        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        Increment delay:
        <button disabled={delay === 100} onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d - 100);
        }}>–100 ms</button>
        <b>{delay} ms</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d + 100);
        }}>+100 ms</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```


```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The problem with the above example is that it extracted an Effect Event called `onMount` without considering what the code should actually be doing. You should only extract Effect Events for a specific reason: when you want to make a part of your code non-reactive. However, the `setInterval` call *should* be reactive with respect to the `delay` state variable. If the `delay` changes, you want to set up the interval from scratch! To fix this code, pull all the reactive code back inside the Effect:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(100);

  const onTick = useEffectEvent(() => {
    setCount(c => c + increment);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      onTick();
    }, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    }
  }, [delay]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        Increment delay:
        <button disabled={delay === 100} onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d - 100);
        }}>–100 ms</button>
        <b>{delay} ms</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setDelay(d => d + 100);
        }}>+100 ms</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In general, you should be suspicious of functions like `onMount` that focus on the *timing* rather than the *purpose* of a piece of code. It may feel "more descriptive" at first but it obscures your intent. As a rule of thumb, Effect Events should correspond to something that happens from the *user's* perspective. For example, `onMessage`, `onTick`, `onVisit`, or `onConnected` are good Effect Event names. Code inside them would likely not need to be reactive. On the other hand, `onMount`, `onUpdate`, `onUnmount`, or `onAfterRender` are so generic that it's easy to accidentally put code that *should* be reactive into them. This is why you should name your Effect Events after *what the user thinks has happened,* not when some code happened to run.

</Solution>

#### Fix a delayed notification {/*fix-a-delayed-notification*/}

When you join a chat room, this component shows a notification. However, it doesn't show the notification immediately. Instead, the notification is artificially delayed by two seconds so that the user has a chance to look around the UI.

This almost works, but there is a bug. Try changing the dropdown from "general" to "travel" and then to "music" very quickly. If you do it fast enough, you will see two notifications (as expected!) but they will *both* say "Welcome to music".

Fix it so that when you switch from "general" to "travel" and then to "music" very quickly, you see two notifications, the first one being "Welcome to travel" and the second one being "Welcome to music". (For an additional challenge, assuming you've *already* made the notifications show the correct rooms, change the code so that only the latter notification is displayed.)

<Hint>

Your Effect knows which room it connected to. Is there any information that you might want to pass to your Effect Event?

<Solution>

Inside your Effect Event, `roomId` is the value *at the time Effect Event was called.*

Your Effect Event is called with a two second delay. If you're quickly switching from the travel to the music room, by the time the travel room's notification shows, `roomId` is already `"music"`. This is why both notifications say "Welcome to music".

To fix the issue, instead of reading the *latest* `roomId` inside the Effect Event, make it a parameter of your Effect Event, like `connectedRoomId` below. Then pass `roomId` from your Effect by calling `onConnected(roomId)`:

<Sandpack>

```json package.json hidden

The Effect that had `roomId` set to `"travel"` (so it connected to the `"travel"` room) will show the notification for `"travel"`. The Effect that had `roomId` set to `"music"` (so it connected to the `"music"` room) will show the notification for `"music"`. In other words, `connectedRoomId` comes from your Effect (which is reactive), while `theme` always uses the latest value.

To solve the additional challenge, save the notification timeout ID and clear it in the cleanup function of your Effect:

title: 'Removing Effect Dependencies'
---

<Intro>

When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you've included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect's dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. Follow this guide to review and remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

- How to fix infinite Effect dependency loops
- What to do when you want to remove a dependency
- How to read a value from your Effect without "reacting" to it
- How and why to avoid object and function dependencies
- Why suppressing the dependency linter is dangerous, and what to do instead

</YouWillLearn>

## Dependencies should match the code {/*dependencies-should-match-the-code*/}

When you write an Effect, you first specify how to [start and stop](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#the-lifecycle-of-an-effect) whatever you want your Effect to be doing:

```js {5-7}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  	// ...
}
```

Then, if you leave the Effect dependencies empty (`[]`), the linter will suggest the correct dependencies:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // <-- Fix the mistake here!
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Fill them in according to what the linter says:

```js {6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}

[Effects "react" to reactive values.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) Since `roomId` is a reactive value (it can change due to a re-render), the linter verifies that you've specified it as a dependency. If `roomId` receives a different value, React will re-synchronize your Effect. This ensures that the chat stays connected to the selected room and "reacts" to the dropdown:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### To remove a dependency, prove that it's not a dependency {/*to-remove-a-dependency-prove-that-its-not-a-dependency*/}

Notice that you can't "choose" the dependencies of your Effect. Every <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep> used by your Effect's code must be declared in your dependency list. The dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:

```js [[2, 3, "roomId"], [2, 5, "roomId"], [2, 8, "roomId"]]
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads that reactive value
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify that reactive value as a dependency of your Effect
  // ...
}
```

[Reactive values](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive) include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since `roomId` is a reactive value, you can't remove it from the dependency list. The linter wouldn't allow it:

```js {8}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'roomId'
  // ...
}
```

And the linter would be right! Since `roomId` may change over time, this would introduce a bug in your code.

**To remove a dependency, "prove" to the linter that it *doesn't need* to be a dependency.** For example, you can move `roomId` out of your component to prove that it's not reactive and won't change on re-renders:

```js {2,9}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now that `roomId` is not a reactive value (and can't change on a re-render), it doesn't need to be a dependency:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'music';

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This is why you could now specify an [empty (`[]`) dependency list.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means) Your Effect *really doesn't* depend on any reactive value anymore, so it *really doesn't* need to re-run when any of the component's props or state change.

### To change the dependencies, change the code {/*to-change-the-dependencies-change-the-code*/}

You might have noticed a pattern in your workflow:

1. First, you **change the code** of your Effect or how your reactive values are declared.
2. Then, you follow the linter and adjust the dependencies to **match the code you have changed.**
3. If you're not happy with the list of dependencies, you **go back to the first step** (and change the code again).

The last part is important. **If you want to change the dependencies, change the surrounding code first.** You can think of the dependency list as [a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect's code.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) You don't *choose* what to put on that list. The list *describes* your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.

This might feel like solving an equation. You might start with a goal (for example, to remove a dependency), and you need to "find" the code matching that goal. Not everyone finds solving equations fun, and the same thing could be said about writing Effects! Luckily, there is a list of common recipes that you can try below.

<Pitfall>

If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:

```js {3-4}
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:
  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);
```

**When dependencies don't match the code, there is a very high risk of introducing bugs.** By suppressing the linter, you "lie" to React about the values your Effect depends on.

Instead, use the techniques below.

</Pitfall>

<DeepDive>

#### Why is suppressing the dependency linter so dangerous? {/*why-is-suppressing-the-dependency-linter-so-dangerous*/}

Suppressing the linter leads to very unintuitive bugs that are hard to find and fix. Here's one example:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [14]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  function onTick() {
	setCount(count + increment);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Let's say that you wanted to run the Effect "only on mount". You've read that [empty (`[]`) dependencies](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means) do that, so you've decided to ignore the linter, and forcefully specified `[]` as the dependencies.

This counter was supposed to increment every second by the amount configurable with the two buttons. However, since you "lied" to React that this Effect doesn't depend on anything, React forever keeps using the `onTick` function from the initial render. [During that render,](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time) `count` was `0` and `increment` was `1`. This is why `onTick` from that render always calls `setCount(0 + 1)` every second, and you always see `1`. Bugs like this are harder to fix when they're spread across multiple components.

There's always a better solution than ignoring the linter! To fix this code, you need to add `onTick` to the dependency list. (To ensure the interval is only setup once, [make `onTick` an Effect Event.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events))

**We recommend treating the dependency lint error as a compilation error. If you don't suppress it, you will never see bugs like this.** The rest of this page documents the alternatives for this and other cases.

</DeepDive>

## Removing unnecessary dependencies {/*removing-unnecessary-dependencies*/}

Every time you adjust the Effect's dependencies to reflect the code, look at the dependency list. Does it make sense for the Effect to re-run when any of these dependencies change? Sometimes, the answer is "no":

* You might want to re-execute *different parts* of your Effect under different conditions.
* You might want to only read the *latest value* of some dependency instead of "reacting" to its changes.
* A dependency may change too often *unintentionally* because it's an object or a function.

To find the right solution, you'll need to answer a few questions about your Effect. Let's walk through them.

### Should this code move to an event handler? {/*should-this-code-move-to-an-event-handler*/}

The first thing you should think about is whether this code should be an Effect at all.

Imagine a form. On submit, you set the `submitted` state variable to `true`. You need to send a POST request and show a notification. You've put this logic inside an Effect that "reacts" to `submitted` being `true`:

```js {6-8}
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
      post('/api/register');
      showNotification('Successfully registered!');
    }
  }, [submitted]);

  function handleSubmit() {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }

  // ...
}
```

Later, you want to style the notification message according to the current theme, so you read the current theme. Since `theme` is declared in the component body, it is a reactive value, so you add it as a dependency:

```js {3,9,11}
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
      post('/api/register');
      showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);
    }
  }, [submitted, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  function handleSubmit() {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

By doing this, you've introduced a bug. Imagine you submit the form first and then switch between Dark and Light themes. The `theme` will change, the Effect will re-run, and so it will display the same notification again!

**The problem here is that this shouldn't be an Effect in the first place.** You want to send this POST request and show the notification in response to *submitting the form,* which is a particular interaction. To run some code in response to particular interaction, put that logic directly into the corresponding event handler:

```js {6-7}
function Form() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  function handleSubmit() {
    // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers
    post('/api/register');
    showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

Now that the code is in an event handler, it's not reactive--so it will only run when the user submits the form. Read more about [choosing between event handlers and Effects](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reactive-values-and-reactive-logic) and [how to delete unnecessary Effects.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

### Is your Effect doing several unrelated things? {/*is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things*/}

The next question you should ask yourself is whether your Effect is doing several unrelated things.

Imagine you're creating a shipping form where the user needs to choose their city and area. You fetch the list of `cities` from the server according to the selected `country` to show them in a dropdown:

```js
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

This is a good example of [fetching data in an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#fetching-data) You are synchronizing the `cities` state with the network according to the `country` prop. You can't do this in an event handler because you need to fetch as soon as `ShippingForm` is displayed and whenever the `country` changes (no matter which interaction causes it).

Now let's say you're adding a second select box for city areas, which should fetch the `areas` for the currently selected `city`. You might start by adding a second `fetch` call for the list of areas inside the same Effect:

```js {15-24,28}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    // 🔴 Avoid: A single Effect synchronizes two independent processes
    if (city) {
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
    }
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country, city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

However, since the Effect now uses the `city` state variable, you've had to add `city` to the list of dependencies. That, in turn, introduced a problem: when the user selects a different city, the Effect will re-run and call `fetchCities(country)`. As a result, you will be unnecessarily refetching the list of cities many times.

**The problem with this code is that you're synchronizing two different unrelated things:**

1. You want to synchronize the `cities` state to the network based on the `country` prop.
1. You want to synchronize the `areas` state to the network based on the `city` state.

Split the logic into two Effects, each of which reacts to the prop that it needs to synchronize with:

```js {19-33}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (city) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

Now the first Effect only re-runs if the `country` changes, while the second Effect re-runs when the `city` changes. You've separated them by purpose: two different things are synchronized by two separate Effects. Two separate Effects have two separate dependency lists, so they won't trigger each other unintentionally.

The final code is longer than the original, but splitting these Effects is still correct. [Each Effect should represent an independent synchronization process.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process) In this example, deleting one Effect doesn't break the other Effect's logic. This means they *synchronize different things,* and it's good to split them up. If you're concerned about duplication, you can improve this code by [extracting repetitive logic into a custom Hook.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#when-to-use-custom-hooks)

### Are you reading some state to calculate the next state? {/*are-you-reading-some-state-to-calculate-the-next-state*/}

This Effect updates the `messages` state variable with a newly created array every time a new message arrives:

```js {2,6-8}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);
    });
    // ...
```

It uses the `messages` variable to [create a new array](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) starting with all the existing messages and adds the new message at the end. However, since `messages` is a reactive value read by an Effect, it must be a dependency:

```js {7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, messages]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

And making `messages` a dependency introduces a problem.

Every time you receive a message, `setMessages()` causes the component to re-render with a new `messages` array that includes the received message. However, since this Effect now depends on `messages`, this will *also* re-synchronize the Effect. So every new message will make the chat re-connect. The user would not like that!

To fix the issue, don't read `messages` inside the Effect. Instead, pass an [updater function](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) to `setMessages`:

```js {7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

**Notice how your Effect does not read the `messages` variable at all now.** You only need to pass an updater function like `msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]`. React [puts your updater function in a queue](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) and will provide the `msgs` argument to it during the next render. This is why the Effect itself doesn't need to depend on `messages` anymore. As a result of this fix, receiving a chat message will no longer make the chat re-connect.

### Do you want to read a value without "reacting" to its changes? {/*do-you-want-to-read-a-value-without-reacting-to-its-changes*/}

Suppose that you want to play a sound when the user receives a new message unless `isMuted` is `true`:

```js {3,10-12}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
      if (!isMuted) {
        playSound();
      }
    });
    // ...
```

Since your Effect now uses `isMuted` in its code, you have to add it to the dependencies:

```js {10,15}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
      if (!isMuted) {
        playSound();
      }
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, isMuted]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

The problem is that every time `isMuted` changes (for example, when the user presses the "Muted" toggle), the Effect will re-synchronize, and reconnect to the chat. This is not the desired user experience! (In this example, even disabling the linter would not work--if you do that, `isMuted` would get "stuck" with its old value.)

To solve this problem, you need to extract the logic that shouldn't be reactive out of the Effect. You don't want this Effect to "react" to the changes in `isMuted`. [Move this non-reactive piece of logic into an Effect Event:](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#declaring-an-effect-event)

```js {1,7-12,18,21}
import { useState, useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(false);

  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {
    setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
    if (!isMuted) {
      playSound();
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Effect Events let you split an Effect into reactive parts (which should "react" to reactive values like `roomId` and their changes) and non-reactive parts (which only read their latest values, like `onMessage` reads `isMuted`). **Now that you read `isMuted` inside an Effect Event, it doesn't need to be a dependency of your Effect.** As a result, the chat won't re-connect when you toggle the "Muted" setting on and off, solving the original issue!

#### Wrapping an event handler from the props {/*wrapping-an-event-handler-from-the-props*/}

You might run into a similar problem when your component receives an event handler as a prop:

```js {1,8,11}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Suppose that the parent component passes a *different* `onReceiveMessage` function on every render:

```js {3-5}
<ChatRoom
  roomId={roomId}
  onReceiveMessage={receivedMessage => {
    // ...
  }}
/>
```

Since `onReceiveMessage` is a dependency, it would cause the Effect to re-synchronize after every parent re-render. This would make it re-connect to the chat. To solve this, wrap the call in an Effect Event:

```js {4-6,12,15}
function ChatRoom({ roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(receivedMessage => {
    onReceiveMessage(receivedMessage);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      onMessage(receivedMessage);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Effect Events aren't reactive, so you don't need to specify them as dependencies. As a result, the chat will no longer re-connect even if the parent component passes a function that's different on every re-render.

#### Separating reactive and non-reactive code {/*separating-reactive-and-non-reactive-code*/}

In this example, you want to log a visit every time `roomId` changes. You want to include the current `notificationCount` with every log, but you *don't* want a change to `notificationCount` to trigger a log event.

The solution is again to split out the non-reactive code into an Effect Event:

```js {2-4,7}
function Chat({ roomId, notificationCount }) {
  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedRoomId => {
    logVisit(visitedRoomId, notificationCount);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(roomId);
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

You want your logic to be reactive with regards to `roomId`, so you read `roomId` inside of your Effect. However, you don't want a change to `notificationCount` to log an extra visit, so you read `notificationCount` inside of the Effect Event. [Learn more about reading the latest props and state from Effects using Effect Events.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events)

### Does some reactive value change unintentionally? {/*does-some-reactive-value-change-unintentionally*/}

Sometimes, you *do* want your Effect to "react" to a certain value, but that value changes more often than you'd like--and might not reflect any actual change from the user's perspective. For example, let's say that you create an `options` object in the body of your component, and then read that object from inside of your Effect:

```js {3-6,9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  // ...
  const options = {
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

This object is declared in the component body, so it's a [reactive value.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) When you read a reactive value like this inside an Effect, you declare it as a dependency. This ensures your Effect "reacts" to its changes:

```js {3,6}
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

It is important to declare it as a dependency! This ensures, for example, that if the `roomId` changes, your Effect will re-connect to the chat with the new `options`. However, there is also a problem with the code above. To see it, try typing into the input in the sandbox below, and watch what happens in the console:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [10]}}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  // Temporarily disable the linter to demonstrate the problem
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  const options = {
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In the sandbox above, the input only updates the `message` state variable. From the user's perspective, this should not affect the chat connection. However, every time you update the `message`, your component re-renders. When your component re-renders, the code inside of it runs again from scratch.

A new `options` object is created from scratch on every re-render of the `ChatRoom` component. React sees that the `options` object is a *different object* from the `options` object created during the last render. This is why it re-synchronizes your Effect (which depends on `options`), and the chat re-connects as you type.

**This problem only affects objects and functions. In JavaScript, each newly created object and function is considered distinct from all the others. It doesn't matter that the contents inside of them may be the same!**

```js {7-8}
// During the first render
const options1 = { serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234', roomId: 'music' };

// During the next render
const options2 = { serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234', roomId: 'music' };

// These are two different objects!
console.log(Object.is(options1, options2)); // false
```

**Object and function dependencies can make your Effect re-synchronize more often than you need.** 

This is why, whenever possible, you should try to avoid objects and functions as your Effect's dependencies. Instead, try moving them outside the component, inside the Effect, or extracting primitive values out of them.

#### Move static objects and functions outside your component {/*move-static-objects-and-functions-outside-your-component*/}

If the object does not depend on any props and state, you can move that object outside your component:

```js {1-4,13}
const options = {
  serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
  roomId: 'music'
};

function ChatRoom() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This way, you *prove* to the linter that it's not reactive. It can't change as a result of a re-render, so it doesn't need to be a dependency. Now re-rendering `ChatRoom` won't cause your Effect to re-synchronize.

This works for functions too:

```js {1-6,12}
function createOptions() {
  return {
    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
    roomId: 'music'
  };
}

function ChatRoom() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Since `createOptions` is declared outside your component, it's not a reactive value. This is why it doesn't need to be specified in your Effect's dependencies, and why it won't ever cause your Effect to re-synchronize.

#### Move dynamic objects and functions inside your Effect {/*move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect*/}

If your object depends on some reactive value that may change as a result of a re-render, like a `roomId` prop, you can't pull it *outside* your component. You can, however, move its creation *inside* of your Effect's code:

```js {7-10,11,14}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

Now that `options` is declared inside of your Effect, it is no longer a dependency of your Effect. Instead, the only reactive value used by your Effect is `roomId`. Since `roomId` is not an object or function, you can be sure that it won't be *unintentionally* different. In JavaScript, numbers and strings are compared by their content:

```js {7-8}
// During the first render
const roomId1 = 'music';

// During the next render
const roomId2 = 'music';

// These two strings are the same!
console.log(Object.is(roomId1, roomId2)); // true
```

Thanks to this fix, the chat no longer re-connects if you edit the input:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

However, it *does* re-connect when you change the `roomId` dropdown, as you would expect.

This works for functions, too:

```js {7-12,14}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    function createOptions() {
      return {
        serverUrl: serverUrl,
        roomId: roomId
      };
    }

    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

You can write your own functions to group pieces of logic inside your Effect. As long as you also declare them *inside* your Effect, they're not reactive values, and so they don't need to be dependencies of your Effect.

#### Read primitive values from objects {/*read-primitive-values-from-objects*/}

Sometimes, you may receive an object from props:

```js {1,5,8}
function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

The risk here is that the parent component will create the object during rendering:

```js {3-6}
<ChatRoom
  roomId={roomId}
  options={{
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  }}
/>
```

This would cause your Effect to re-connect every time the parent component re-renders. To fix this, read information from the object *outside* the Effect, and avoid having object and function dependencies:

```js {4,7-8,12}
function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const { roomId, serverUrl } = options;
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

The logic gets a little repetitive (you read some values from an object outside an Effect, and then create an object with the same values inside the Effect). But it makes it very explicit what information your Effect *actually* depends on. If an object is re-created unintentionally by the parent component, the chat would not re-connect. However, if `options.roomId` or `options.serverUrl` really are different, the chat would re-connect.

#### Calculate primitive values from functions {/*calculate-primitive-values-from-functions*/}

The same approach can work for functions. For example, suppose the parent component passes a function:

```js {3-8}
<ChatRoom
  roomId={roomId}
  getOptions={() => {
    return {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }}
/>
```

To avoid making it a dependency (and causing it to re-connect on re-renders), call it outside the Effect. This gives you the `roomId` and `serverUrl` values that aren't objects, and that you can read from inside your Effect:

```js {1,4}
function ChatRoom({ getOptions }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const { roomId, serverUrl } = getOptions();
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

This only works for [pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure) functions because they are safe to call during rendering. If your function is an event handler, but you don't want its changes to re-synchronize your Effect, [wrap it into an Effect Event instead.](#do-you-want-to-read-a-value-without-reacting-to-its-changes)

<Recap>

- Dependencies should always match the code.
- When you're not happy with your dependencies, what you need to edit is the code.
- Suppressing the linter leads to very confusing bugs, and you should always avoid it.
- To remove a dependency, you need to "prove" to the linter that it's not necessary.
- If some code should run in response to a specific interaction, move that code to an event handler.
- If different parts of your Effect should re-run for different reasons, split it into several Effects.
- If you want to update some state based on the previous state, pass an updater function.
- If you want to read the latest value without "reacting" it, extract an Effect Event from your Effect.
- In JavaScript, objects and functions are considered different if they were created at different times.
- Try to avoid object and function dependencies. Move them outside the component or inside the Effect.

#### Fix a resetting interval {/*fix-a-resetting-interval*/}

This Effect sets up an interval that ticks every second. You've noticed something strange happening: it seems like the interval gets destroyed and re-created every time it ticks. Fix the code so that the interval doesn't get constantly re-created.

<Hint>

It seems like this Effect's code depends on `count`. Is there some way to not need this dependency? There should be a way to update the `count` state based on its previous value without adding a dependency on that value.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('✅ Creating an interval');
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('⏰ Interval tick');
      setCount(count + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      console.log('❌ Clearing an interval');
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [count]);

  return <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You want to update the `count` state to be `count + 1` from inside the Effect. However, this makes your Effect depend on `count`, which changes with every tick, and that's why your interval gets re-created on every tick.

To solve this, use the [updater function](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) and write `setCount(c => c + 1)` instead of `setCount(count + 1)`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('✅ Creating an interval');
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('⏰ Interval tick');
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      console.log('❌ Clearing an interval');
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
}
```

</Sandpack>

Instead of reading `count` inside the Effect, you pass a `c => c + 1` instruction ("increment this number!") to React. React will apply it on the next render. And since you don't need to read the value of `count` inside your Effect anymore, you can keep your Effect's dependencies empty (`[]`). This prevents your Effect from re-creating the interval on every tick.

</Solution>

#### Fix a retriggering animation {/*fix-a-retriggering-animation*/}

In this example, when you press "Show", a welcome message fades in. The animation takes a second. When you press "Remove", the welcome message immediately disappears. The logic for the fade-in animation is implemented in the `animation.js` file as plain JavaScript [animation loop.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) You don't need to change that logic. You can treat it as a third-party library. Your Effect creates an instance of `FadeInAnimation` for the DOM node, and then calls `start(duration)` or `stop()` to control the animation. The `duration` is controlled by a slider. Adjust the slider and see how the animation changes.

This code already works, but there is something you want to change. Currently, when you move the slider that controls the `duration` state variable, it retriggers the animation. Change the behavior so that the Effect does not "react" to the `duration` variable. When you press "Show", the Effect should use the current `duration` on the slider. However, moving the slider itself should not by itself retrigger the animation.

<Hint>

Is there a line of code inside the Effect that should not be reactive? How can you move non-reactive code out of the Effect?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';
import { FadeInAnimation } from './animation.js';

function Welcome({ duration }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const animation = new FadeInAnimation(ref.current);
    animation.start(duration);
    return () => {
      animation.stop();
    };
  }, [duration]);

  return (
    <h1

}
```

```css

html, body { min-height: 300px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Your Effect needs to read the latest value of `duration`, but you don't want it to "react" to changes in `duration`. You use `duration` to start the animation, but starting animation isn't reactive. Extract the non-reactive line of code into an Effect Event, and call that function from your Effect.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { FadeInAnimation } from './animation.js';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function Welcome({ duration }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  const onAppear = useEffectEvent(animation => {
    animation.start(duration);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const animation = new FadeInAnimation(ref.current);
    onAppear(animation);
    return () => {
      animation.stop();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <h1
      ref={ref}
      style={{
        opacity: 0,
        color: 'white',
        padding: 50,
        textAlign: 'center',
        fontSize: 50,
        backgroundImage: 'radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%)'
      }}
    >
      Welcome
    </h1>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [duration, setDuration] = useState(1000);
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="range"
          min="100"
          max="3000"
          value={duration}
          onChange={e => setDuration(Number(e.target.value))}
        />
        <br />
        Fade in duration: {duration} ms
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}
      </button>
      <hr />
      {show && <Welcome duration={duration} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/animation.js
export class FadeInAnimation {
  constructor(node) {
    this.node = node;
  }
  start(duration) {
    this.duration = duration;
    this.onProgress(0);
    this.startTime = performance.now();
    this.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.onFrame());
  }
  onFrame() {
    const timePassed = performance.now() - this.startTime;
    const progress = Math.min(timePassed / this.duration, 1);
    this.onProgress(progress);
    if (progress < 1) {
      // We still have more frames to paint
      this.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.onFrame());
    }
  }
  onProgress(progress) {
    this.node.style.opacity = progress;
  }
  stop() {
    cancelAnimationFrame(this.frameId);
    this.startTime = null;
    this.frameId = null;
    this.duration = 0;
  }
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
html, body { min-height: 300px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Effect Events like `onAppear` are not reactive, so you can read `duration` inside without retriggering the animation.

#### Fix a reconnecting chat {/*fix-a-reconnecting-chat*/}

In this example, every time you press "Toggle theme", the chat re-connects. Why does this happen? Fix the mistake so that the chat re-connects only when you edit the Server URL or choose a different chat room.

Treat `chat.js` as an external third-party library: you can consult it to check its API, but don't edit it.

<Hint>

There's more than one way to fix this, but ultimately you want to avoid having an object as your dependency.

<Solution>

Your Effect is re-running because it depends on the `options` object. Objects can be re-created unintentionally, you should try to avoid them as dependencies of your Effects whenever possible.

The least invasive fix is to read `roomId` and `serverUrl` right outside the Effect, and then make the Effect depend on those primitive values (which can't change unintentionally). Inside the Effect, create an object and pass it to `createConnection`:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  const options = {
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  };

  return (
    <div className={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}>
      <button onClick={() => setIsDark(!isDark)}>
        Toggle theme
      </button>
      <label>
        Server URL:{' '}
        <input
          value={serverUrl}
          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom options={options} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/ChatRoom.js active
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const { roomId, serverUrl } = options;
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {options.roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  if (typeof serverUrl !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected serverUrl to be a string. Received: ' + serverUrl);
  }
  if (typeof roomId !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected roomId to be a string. Received: ' + roomId);
  }
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; }
.dark { background: #222; color: #eee; }
```

</Sandpack>

It would be even better to replace the object `options` prop with the more specific `roomId` and `serverUrl` props:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  return (
    <div className={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}>
      <button onClick={() => setIsDark(!isDark)}>
        Toggle theme
      </button>
      <label>
        Server URL:{' '}
        <input
          value={serverUrl}
          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
        serverUrl={serverUrl}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/ChatRoom.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, serverUrl }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  if (typeof serverUrl !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected serverUrl to be a string. Received: ' + serverUrl);
  }
  if (typeof roomId !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected roomId to be a string. Received: ' + roomId);
  }
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; }
.dark { background: #222; color: #eee; }
```

Sticking to primitive props where possible makes it easier to optimize your components later.

#### Fix a reconnecting chat, again {/*fix-a-reconnecting-chat-again*/}

This example connects to the chat either with or without encryption. Toggle the checkbox and notice the different messages in the console when the encryption is on and off. Try changing the room. Then, try toggling the theme. When you're connected to a chat room, you will receive new messages every few seconds. Verify that their color matches the theme you've picked.

In this example, the chat re-connects every time you try to change the theme. Fix this. After the fix, changing the theme should not re-connect the chat, but toggling encryption settings or changing the room should re-connect.

Don't change any code in `chat.js`. Other than that, you can change any code as long as it results in the same behavior. For example, you may find it helpful to change which props are being passed down.

<Hint>

You're passing down two functions: `onMessage` and `createConnection`. Both of them are created from scratch every time `App` re-renders. They are considered to be new values every time, which is why they re-trigger your Effect.

One of these functions is an event handler. Do you know some way to call an event handler an Effect without "reacting" to the new values of the event handler function? That would come in handy!

Another of these functions only exists to pass some state to an imported API method. Is this function really necessary? What is the essential information that's being passed down? You might need to move some imports from `App.js` to `ChatRoom.js`.

<Solution>

There's more than one correct way to solve this, but here is one possible solution.

In the original example, toggling the theme caused different `onMessage` and `createConnection` functions to be created and passed down. Since the Effect depended on these functions, the chat would re-connect every time you toggle the theme.

To fix the problem with `onMessage`, you needed to wrap it into an Effect Event:

```js {1,2,6}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, createConnection, onMessage }) {
  const onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage);

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => onReceiveMessage(msg));
    // ...
```

Unlike the `onMessage` prop, the `onReceiveMessage` Effect Event is not reactive. This is why it doesn't need to be a dependency of your Effect. As a result, changes to `onMessage` won't cause the chat to re-connect.

You can't do the same with `createConnection` because it *should* be reactive. You *want* the Effect to re-trigger if the user switches between an encrypted and an unencryption connection, or if the user switches the current room. However, because `createConnection` is a function, you can't check whether the information it reads has *actually* changed or not. To solve this, instead of passing `createConnection` down from the `App` component, pass the raw `roomId` and `isEncrypted` values:

```js {2-3}
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
        isEncrypted={isEncrypted}
        onMessage={msg => {
          showNotification('New message: ' + msg, isDark ? 'dark' : 'light');
        }}
      />
```

Now you can move the `createConnection` function *inside* the Effect instead of passing it down from the `App`:

```js {1-4,6,10-20}
import {
  createEncryptedConnection,
  createUnencryptedConnection,
} from './chat.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, isEncrypted, onMessage }) {
  const onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage);

  useEffect(() => {
    function createConnection() {
      const options = {
        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
        roomId: roomId
      };
      if (isEncrypted) {
        return createEncryptedConnection(options);
      } else {
        return createUnencryptedConnection(options);
      }
    }
    // ...
```

After these two changes, your Effect no longer depends on any function values:

```js {1,8,10,21}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId, isEncrypted, onMessage }) { // Reactive values
  const onReceiveMessage = useEffectEvent(onMessage); // Not reactive

  useEffect(() => {
    function createConnection() {
      const options = {
        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
        roomId: roomId // Reading a reactive value
      };
      if (isEncrypted) { // Reading a reactive value
        return createEncryptedConnection(options);
      } else {
        return createUnencryptedConnection(options);
      }
    }

    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => onReceiveMessage(msg));
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, isEncrypted]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
```

As a result, the chat re-connects only when something meaningful (`roomId` or `isEncrypted`) changes:

title: 'Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks'
---

<Intro>

React comes with several built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, and `useEffect`. Sometimes, you'll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application's needs.

</Intro>

- What custom Hooks are, and how to write your own
- How to reuse logic between components
- How to name and structure your custom Hooks
- When and why to extract custom Hooks

</YouWillLearn>

## Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components {/*custom-hooks-sharing-logic-between-components*/}

Imagine you're developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you'll need two things in your component:

1. A piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.
2. An Effect that subscribes to the global [`online`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_event) and [`offline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/offline_event) events, and updates that state.

This will keep your component [synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with the network status. You might start with something like this:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try turning your network on and off, and notice how this `StatusBar` updates in response to your actions.

Now imagine you *also* want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a Save button that will become disabled and show "Reconnecting..." instead of "Save" while the network is off.

To start, you can copy and paste the `isOnline` state and the Effect into `SaveButton`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Verify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.

These two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different *visual appearance,* you want to reuse the logic between them.

### Extracting your own custom Hook from a component {/*extracting-your-own-custom-hook-from-a-component*/}

Imagine for a moment that, similar to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) and [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect), there was a built-in `useOnlineStatus` Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them:

```js {2,7}
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Although there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called `useOnlineStatus` and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier:

```js {2-16}
function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```

At the end of the function, return `isOnline`. This lets your components read that value:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';

function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SaveButton />
      <StatusBar />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useOnlineStatus.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Verify that switching the network on and off updates both components.

Now your components don't have as much repetitive logic. **More importantly, the code inside them describes *what they want to do* (use the online status!) rather than *how to do it* (by subscribing to the browser events).**

When you extract logic into custom Hooks, you can hide the gnarly details of how you deal with some external system or a browser API. The code of your components expresses your intent, not the implementation.

### Hook names always start with `use` {/*hook-names-always-start-with-use*/}

React applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You'll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself!

You must follow these naming conventions:

1. **React component names must start with a capital letter,** like `StatusBar` and `SaveButton`. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX.
2. **Hook names must start with `use` followed by a capital letter,** like [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) (built-in) or `useOnlineStatus` (custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values.

This convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might "hide". For example, if you see a `getColor()` function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can't possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn't start with `use`. However, a function call like `useOnlineStatus()` will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside!

<Note>

If your linter is [configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) it will enforce this naming convention. Scroll up to the sandbox above and rename `useOnlineStatus` to `getOnlineStatus`. Notice that the linter won't allow you to call `useState` or `useEffect` inside of it anymore. Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!

</Note>

<DeepDive>

#### Should all functions called during rendering start with the use prefix? {/*should-all-functions-called-during-rendering-start-with-the-use-prefix*/}

No. Functions that don't *call* Hooks don't need to *be* Hooks.

If your function doesn't call any Hooks, avoid the `use` prefix. Instead, write it as a regular function *without* the `use` prefix. For example, `useSorted` below doesn't call Hooks, so call it `getSorted` instead:

```js
// 🔴 Avoid: A Hook that doesn't use Hooks
function useSorted(items) {
  return items.slice().sort();
}

// ✅ Good: A regular function that doesn't use Hooks
function getSorted(items) {
  return items.slice().sort();
}
```

This ensures that your code can call this regular function anywhere, including conditions:

```js
function List({ items, shouldSort }) {
  let displayedItems = items;
  if (shouldSort) {
    // ✅ It's ok to call getSorted() conditionally because it's not a Hook
    displayedItems = getSorted(items);
  }
  // ...
}
```

You should give `use` prefix to a function (and thus make it a Hook) if it uses at least one Hook inside of it:

```js
// ✅ Good: A Hook that uses other Hooks
function useAuth() {
  return useContext(Auth);
}
```

Technically, this isn't enforced by React. In principle, you could make a Hook that doesn't call other Hooks. This is often confusing and limiting so it's best to avoid that pattern. However, there may be rare cases where it is helpful. For example, maybe your function doesn't use any Hooks right now, but you plan to add some Hook calls to it in the future. Then it makes sense to name it with the `use` prefix:

```js {3-4}
// ✅ Good: A Hook that will likely use some other Hooks later
function useAuth() {
  // TODO: Replace with this line when authentication is implemented:
  // return useContext(Auth);
  return TEST_USER;
}
```

Then components won't be able to call it conditionally. This will become important when you actually add Hook calls inside. If you don't plan to use Hooks inside it (now or later), don't make it a Hook.

</DeepDive>

### Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic, not state itself {/*custom-hooks-let-you-share-stateful-logic-not-state-itself*/}

In the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it's wrong to think that a single `isOnline` state variable is shared between them. Look at this code:

```js {2,7}
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

It works the same way as before you extracted the duplication:

```js {2-5,10-13}
function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

These are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on).

To better illustrate this, we'll need a different example. Consider this `Form` component:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Mary');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Poppins');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p><b>Good morning, {firstName} {lastName}.</b></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

There's some repetitive logic for each form field:

1. There's a piece of state (`firstName` and `lastName`).
1. There's a change handler (`handleFirstNameChange` and `handleLastNameChange`).
1. There's a piece of JSX that specifies the `value` and `onChange` attributes for that input.

You can extract the repetitive logic into this `useFormInput` custom Hook:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useFormInput } from './useFormInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');
  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input {...firstNameProps} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input {...lastNameProps} />
      </label>
      <p><b>Good morning, {firstNameProps.value} {lastNameProps.value}.</b></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useFormInput.js active
import { useState } from 'react';

export function useFormInput(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  function handleChange(e) {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  }

  const inputProps = {
    value: value,
    onChange: handleChange
  };

  return inputProps;
}
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice that it only declares *one* state variable called `value`.

However, the `Form` component calls `useFormInput` *two times:*

```js
function Form() {
  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');
  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');
  // ...
```

This is why it works like declaring two separate state variables!

**Custom Hooks let you share *stateful logic* but not *state itself.* Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook.** This is why the two sandboxes above are completely equivalent. If you'd like, scroll back up and compare them. The behavior before and after extracting a custom Hook is identical.

When you need to share the state itself between multiple components, [lift it up and pass it down](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) instead.

## Passing reactive values between Hooks {/*passing-reactive-values-between-hooks*/}

The code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks [need to be pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Think of custom Hooks' code as part of your component's body!

Because custom Hooks re-render together with your component, they always receive the latest props and state. To see what this means, consider this chat room example. Change the server URL or the chat room:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/ChatRoom.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  if (typeof serverUrl !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected serverUrl to be a string. Received: ' + serverUrl);
  }
  if (typeof roomId !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected roomId to be a string. Received: ' + roomId);
  }
  let intervalId;
  let messageCallback;
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        if (messageCallback) {
          if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            messageCallback('hey')
          } else {
            messageCallback('lol');
          }
        }
      }, 3000);
    },
    disconnect() {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      messageCallback = null;
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '');
    },
    on(event, callback) {
      if (messageCallback) {
        throw Error('Cannot add the handler twice.');
      }
      if (event !== 'message') {
        throw Error('Only "message" event is supported.');
      }
      messageCallback = callback;
    },
  };
}
```

```js src/notifications.js
import Toastify from 'toastify-js';
import 'toastify-js/src/toastify.css';

export function showNotification(message, theme = 'dark') {
  Toastify({
    text: message,
    duration: 2000,
    gravity: 'top',
    position: 'right',
    style: {
      background: theme === 'dark' ? 'black' : 'white',
      color: theme === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'black',
    },
  }).showToast();
}
```

```json package.json hidden
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",
    "react-scripts": "latest",
    "toastify-js": "1.12.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

When you change `serverUrl` or `roomId`, the Effect ["reacts" to your changes](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) and re-synchronizes. You can tell by the console messages that the chat re-connects every time that you change your Effect's dependencies.

Now move the Effect's code into a custom Hook:

```js {2-13}
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

This lets your `ChatRoom` component call your custom Hook without worrying about how it works inside:

```js {4-7}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

This looks much simpler! (But it does the same thing.)

Notice that the logic *still responds* to prop and state changes. Try editing the server URL or the selected room:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/ChatRoom.js active
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useChatRoom.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

```js src/chat.js

  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  if (typeof serverUrl !== 'string') {

  if (typeof roomId !== 'string') {

  }
  let intervalId;
  let messageCallback;
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        if (messageCallback) {
          if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            messageCallback('hey')
          } else {
            messageCallback('lol');
          }
        }
      }, 3000);
    },
    disconnect() {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      messageCallback = null;
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '');
    },
    on(event, callback) {

      }

        throw Error('Only "message" event is supported.');
      }
      messageCallback = callback;
    },
  };
}
```

```js src/notifications.js
import Toastify from 'toastify-js';
import 'toastify-js/src/toastify.css';

export function showNotification(message, theme = 'dark') {
  Toastify({
    text: message,
    duration: 2000,
    gravity: 'top',
    position: 'right',
    style: {
      background: theme === 'dark' ? 'black' : 'white',
      color: theme === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'black',
    },
  }).showToast();
}
```

  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

Notice how you're taking the return value of one Hook:

```js {2}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```

and passing it as an input to another Hook:

```js {6}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```

Every time your `ChatRoom` component re-renders, it passes the latest `roomId` and `serverUrl` to your Hook. This is why your Effect re-connects to the chat whenever their values are different after a re-render. (If you ever worked with audio or video processing software, chaining Hooks like this might remind you of chaining visual or audio effects. It's as if the output of `useState` "feeds into" the input of the `useChatRoom`.)

### Passing event handlers to custom Hooks {/*passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks*/}

As you start using `useChatRoom` in more components, you might want to let components customize its behavior. For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:

```js {9-11}
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

Let's say you want to move this logic back to your component:

```js {7-9}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    onReceiveMessage(msg) {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    }
  });
  // ...
```

To make this work, change your custom Hook to take `onReceiveMessage` as one of its named options:

```js {1,10,13}
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onReceiveMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```

This will work, but there's one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.

Adding a dependency on `onReceiveMessage` is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. [Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#wrapping-an-event-handler-from-the-props)

```js {1,4,5,15,18}
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';
// ...

export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```

Now the chat won't re-connect every time that the `ChatRoom` component re-renders. Here is a fully working demo of passing an event handler to a custom Hook that you can play with:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/ChatRoom.js active
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    onReceiveMessage(msg) {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    }
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useChatRoom.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  if (typeof serverUrl !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected serverUrl to be a string. Received: ' + serverUrl);
  }
  if (typeof roomId !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Expected roomId to be a string. Received: ' + roomId);
  }
  let intervalId;
  let messageCallback;
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        if (messageCallback) {
          if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            messageCallback('hey')
          } else {
            messageCallback('lol');
          }
        }
      }, 3000);
    },
    disconnect() {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      messageCallback = null;
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '');
    },
    on(event, callback) {
      if (messageCallback) {
        throw Error('Cannot add the handler twice.');
      }
      if (event !== 'message') {
        throw Error('Only "message" event is supported.');
      }
      messageCallback = callback;
    },
  };
}
```

export function showNotification(message, theme = 'dark') {
  Toastify({
    text: message,
    duration: 2000,
    gravity: 'top',
    position: 'right',
    style: {
      background: theme === 'dark' ? 'black' : 'white',
      color: theme === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'black',

Notice how you no longer need to know *how* `useChatRoom` works in order to use it. You could add it to any other component, pass any other options, and it would work the same way. That's the power of custom Hooks.

## When to use custom Hooks {/*when-to-use-custom-hooks*/}

You don't need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a `useFormInput` Hook to wrap a single `useState` call like earlier is probably unnecessary.

However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. [You shouldn't need Effects very often,](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) so if you're writing one, it means that you need to "step outside React" to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn't have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.

For example, consider a `ShippingForm` component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:

```js {3-16,20-35}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  // This Effect fetches cities for a country
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]);

  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);
  // This Effect fetches areas for the selected city
  useEffect(() => {
    if (city) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [city]);

  // ...
```

Although this code is quite repetitive, [it's correct to keep these Effects separate from each other.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things) They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn't merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the `ShippingForm` component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own `useData` Hook:

```js {2-18}
function useData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (url) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setData(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [url]);
  return data;
}
```

Now you can replace both Effects in the `ShippingForm` components with calls to `useData`:

```js {2,4}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);
  // ...
```

Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the `url` in and you get the `data` out. By "hiding" your Effect inside `useData`, you also prevent someone working on the `ShippingForm` component from adding [unnecessary dependencies](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) to it. With time, most of your app's Effects will be in custom Hooks.

<DeepDive>

#### Keep your custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases {/*keep-your-custom-hooks-focused-on-concrete-high-level-use-cases*/}

Start by choosing your custom Hook's name. If you struggle to pick a clear name, it might mean that your Effect is too coupled to the rest of your component's logic, and is not yet ready to be extracted.

Ideally, your custom Hook's name should be clear enough that even a person who doesn't write code often could have a good guess about what your custom Hook does, what it takes, and what it returns:

* ✅ `useData(url)`
* ✅ `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)`
* ✅ `useChatRoom(options)`

When you synchronize with an external system, your custom Hook name may be more technical and use jargon specific to that system. It's good as long as it would be clear to a person familiar with that system:

* ✅ `useMediaQuery(query)`
* ✅ `useSocket(url)`
* ✅ `useIntersectionObserver(ref, options)`

**Keep custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases.** Avoid creating and using custom "lifecycle" Hooks that act as alternatives and convenience wrappers for the `useEffect` API itself:

* 🔴 `useMount(fn)`
* 🔴 `useEffectOnce(fn)`
* 🔴 `useUpdateEffect(fn)`

For example, this `useMount` Hook tries to ensure some code only runs "on mount":

```js {4-5,14-15}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // 🔴 Avoid: using custom "lifecycle" Hooks
  useMount(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({ roomId, serverUrl });
    connection.connect();

    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });
  });
  // ...
}

// 🔴 Avoid: creating custom "lifecycle" Hooks
function useMount(fn) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fn();
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'
}
```

**Custom "lifecycle" Hooks like `useMount` don't fit well into the React paradigm.** For example, this code example has a mistake (it doesn't "react" to `roomId` or `serverUrl` changes), but the linter won't warn you about it because the linter only checks direct `useEffect` calls. It won't know about your Hook.

If you're writing an Effect, start by using the React API directly:

```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // ✅ Good: two raw Effects separated by purpose

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat', roomId });
  }, [roomId]);

  // ...
}
```

Then, you can (but don't have to) extract custom Hooks for different high-level use cases:

```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // ✅ Great: custom Hooks named after their purpose
  useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId });
  useImpressionLog('visit_chat', { roomId });
  // ...
}
```

**A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining what it does.** For example, `useChatRoom(options)` can only connect to the chat room, while `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)` can only send an impression log to the analytics. If your custom Hook API doesn't constrain the use cases and is very abstract, in the long run it's likely to introduce more problems than it solves.

</DeepDive>

### Custom Hooks help you migrate to better patterns {/*custom-hooks-help-you-migrate-to-better-patterns*/}

Effects are an ["escape hatch"](/learn/escape-hatches): you use them when you need to "step outside React" and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team's goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.

Let's return to this example:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';

function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SaveButton />
      <StatusBar />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useOnlineStatus.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In the above example, `useOnlineStatus` is implemented with a pair of [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) and [`useEffect`.](/reference/react/useEffect) However, this isn't the best possible solution. There is a number of edge cases it doesn't consider. For example, it assumes that when the component mounts, `isOnline` is already `true`, but this may be wrong if the network already went offline. You can use the browser [`navigator.onLine`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine) API to check for that, but using it directly would not work on the server for generating the initial HTML. In short, this code could be improved.

React includes a dedicated API called [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) which takes care of all of these problems for you. Here is your `useOnlineStatus` Hook, rewritten to take advantage of this new API:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';

function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SaveButton />
      <StatusBar />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useOnlineStatus.js active
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe,
    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client
    () => true // How to get the value on the server
  );
}

```

</Sandpack>

Notice how **you didn't need to change any of the components** to make this migration:

```js {2,7}
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

This is another reason for why wrapping Effects in custom Hooks is often beneficial:

1. You make the data flow to and from your Effects very explicit.
2. You let your components focus on the intent rather than on the exact implementation of your Effects.
3. When React adds new features, you can remove those Effects without changing any of your components.

Similar to a [design system,](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969) you might find it helpful to start extracting common idioms from your app's components into custom Hooks. This will keep your components' code focused on the intent, and let you avoid writing raw Effects very often. Many excellent custom Hooks are maintained by the React community.

<DeepDive>

#### Will React provide any built-in solution for data fetching? {/*will-react-provide-any-built-in-solution-for-data-fetching*/}

Today, with the [`use`](/reference/react/use#streaming-data-from-server-to-client) API, data can be read in render by passing a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to `use`:

```js {1,4,11}
import { use, Suspense } from "react";

function Message({ messagePromise }) {
  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);
  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;
}

export function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>
      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

We're still working out the details, but we expect that in the future, you'll write data fetching like this:

```js {1,4,6}
import { use } from 'react';

function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const cities = use(fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`));
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const areas = city ? use(fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)) : null;
  // ...
```

If you use custom Hooks like `useData` above in your app, it will require fewer changes to migrate to the eventually recommended approach than if you write raw Effects in every component manually. However, the old approach will still work fine, so if you feel happy writing raw Effects, you can continue to do that.

</DeepDive>

### There is more than one way to do it {/*there-is-more-than-one-way-to-do-it*/}

Let's say you want to implement a fade-in animation *from scratch* using the browser [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) API. You might start with an Effect that sets up an animation loop. During each frame of the animation, you could change the opacity of the DOM node you [hold in a ref](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs) until it reaches `1`. Your code might start like this:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function Welcome() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const duration = 1000;
    const node = ref.current;

    let startTime = performance.now();
    let frameId = null;

    function onFrame(now) {
      const timePassed = now - startTime;
      const progress = Math.min(timePassed / duration, 1);
      onProgress(progress);
      if (progress < 1) {
        // We still have more frames to paint
        frameId = requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
      }
    }

    function onProgress(progress) {
      node.style.opacity = progress;
    }

    function start() {
      onProgress(0);
      startTime = performance.now();
      frameId = requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
    }

    function stop() {
      cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);
      startTime = null;
      frameId = null;
    }

    start();
    return () => stop();
  }, []);

  return (
    <h1 className="welcome" ref={ref}>
      Welcome
    </h1>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}
      </button>
      <hr />
      {show && <Welcome />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
html, body { min-height: 300px; }
.welcome {
  opacity: 0;
  color: white;
  padding: 50px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 50px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%);
}
```

</Sandpack>

To make the component more readable, you might extract the logic into a `useFadeIn` custom Hook:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useFadeIn } from './useFadeIn.js';

function Welcome() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useFadeIn(ref, 1000);

  return (
    <h1 className="welcome" ref={ref}>
      Welcome
    </h1>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}
      </button>
      <hr />
      {show && <Welcome />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useFadeIn.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export function useFadeIn(ref, duration) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const node = ref.current;

    let startTime = performance.now();
    let frameId = null;

    function onFrame(now) {
      const timePassed = now - startTime;
      const progress = Math.min(timePassed / duration, 1);
      onProgress(progress);
      if (progress < 1) {
        // We still have more frames to paint
        frameId = requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
      }
    }

    function onProgress(progress) {
      node.style.opacity = progress;
    }

    function start() {
      onProgress(0);
      startTime = performance.now();
      frameId = requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
    }

    function stop() {
      cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);
      startTime = null;
      frameId = null;
    }

    start();
    return () => stop();
  }, [ref, duration]);
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
html, body { min-height: 300px; }
.welcome {
  opacity: 0;
  color: white;
  padding: 50px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 50px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%);
}
```

</Sandpack>

You could keep the `useFadeIn` code as is, but you could also refactor it more. For example, you could extract the logic for setting up the animation loop out of `useFadeIn` into a custom `useAnimationLoop` Hook:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useFadeIn } from './useFadeIn.js';

function Welcome() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useFadeIn(ref, 1000);

  return (
    <h1 className="welcome" ref={ref}>
      Welcome
    </h1>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}
      </button>
      <hr />
      {show && <Welcome />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useFadeIn.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export function useFadeIn(ref, duration) {
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(true);

  useAnimationLoop(isRunning, (timePassed) => {
    const progress = Math.min(timePassed / duration, 1);
    ref.current.style.opacity = progress;
    if (progress === 1) {
      setIsRunning(false);
    }
  });
}

function useAnimationLoop(isRunning, drawFrame) {
  const onFrame = useEffectEvent(drawFrame);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isRunning) {
      return;
    }

    const startTime = performance.now();
    let frameId = null;

    function tick(now) {
      const timePassed = now - startTime;
      onFrame(timePassed);
      frameId = requestAnimationFrame(tick);
    }

    tick();
    return () => cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);
  }, [isRunning]);
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
html, body { min-height: 300px; }
.welcome {
  opacity: 0;
  color: white;
  padding: 50px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 50px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%);
}
```

</Sandpack>

However, you didn't *have to* do that. As with regular functions, ultimately you decide where to draw the boundaries between different parts of your code. You could also take a very different approach. Instead of keeping the logic in the Effect, you could move most of the imperative logic inside a JavaScript [class:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useFadeIn } from './useFadeIn.js';

function Welcome() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useFadeIn(ref, 1000);

  return (
    <h1 className="welcome" ref={ref}>
      Welcome
    </h1>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}
      </button>
      <hr />
      {show && <Welcome />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useFadeIn.js active
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { FadeInAnimation } from './animation.js';

export function useFadeIn(ref, duration) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const animation = new FadeInAnimation(ref.current);
    animation.start(duration);
    return () => {
      animation.stop();
    };
  }, [ref, duration]);
}
```

```js src/animation.js
export class FadeInAnimation {
  constructor(node) {
    this.node = node;
  }
  start(duration) {
    this.duration = duration;
    this.onProgress(0);
    this.startTime = performance.now();
    this.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.onFrame());
  }
  onFrame() {
    const timePassed = performance.now() - this.startTime;
    const progress = Math.min(timePassed / this.duration, 1);
    this.onProgress(progress);
    if (progress === 1) {
      this.stop();
    } else {
      // We still have more frames to paint
      this.frameId = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.onFrame());
    }
  }
  onProgress(progress) {
    this.node.style.opacity = progress;
  }
  stop() {
    cancelAnimationFrame(this.frameId);
    this.startTime = null;
    this.frameId = null;
    this.duration = 0;
  }
}
```

```css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
html, body { min-height: 300px; }
.welcome {
  opacity: 0;
  color: white;
  padding: 50px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 50px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%);
}
```

</Sandpack>

Effects let you connect React to external systems. The more coordination between Effects is needed (for example, to chain multiple animations), the more it makes sense to extract that logic out of Effects and Hooks *completely* like in the sandbox above. Then, the code you extracted *becomes* the "external system". This lets your Effects stay simple because they only need to send messages to the system you've moved outside React.

The examples above assume that the fade-in logic needs to be written in JavaScript. However, this particular fade-in animation is both simpler and much more efficient to implement with a plain [CSS Animation:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import './welcome.css';

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <h1 className="welcome">
      Welcome
    </h1>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}
      </button>
      <hr />
      {show && <Welcome />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css src/styles.css
label, button { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
html, body { min-height: 300px; }
```

```css src/welcome.css active
.welcome {
  color: white;
  padding: 50px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 50px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(63,94,251,1) 0%, rgba(252,70,107,1) 100%);

  animation: fadeIn 1000ms;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

```

</Sandpack>

Sometimes, you don't even need a Hook!

<Recap>

- Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.
- Custom Hooks must be named starting with `use` followed by a capital letter.
- Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.
- You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.
- All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.
- The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component's code.
- Wrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.
- Don't create custom Hooks like `useMount`. Keep their purpose specific.
- It's up to you how and where to choose the boundaries of your code.

</Recap>

<Challenges>

#### Extract a `useCounter` Hook {/*extract-a-usecounter-hook*/}

This component uses a state variable and an Effect to display a number that increments every second. Extract this logic into a custom Hook called `useCounter`. Your goal is to make the `Counter` component implementation look exactly like this:

```js
export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter();
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

You'll need to write your custom Hook in `useCounter.js` and import it into the `App.js` file.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
// Write your custom Hook in this file!
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Your code should look like this:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter();
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return count;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Notice that `App.js` doesn't need to import `useState` or `useEffect` anymore.

</Solution>

#### Make the counter delay configurable {/*make-the-counter-delay-configurable*/}

In this example, there is a `delay` state variable controlled by a slider, but its value is not used. Pass the `delay` value to your custom `useCounter` Hook, and change the `useCounter` Hook to use the passed `delay` instead of hardcoding `1000` ms.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(1000);
  const count = useCounter();
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Tick duration: {delay} ms
        <br />
        <input
          type="range"
          value={delay}
          min="10"
          max="2000"
          onChange={e => setDelay(Number(e.target.value))}
        />
      </label>
      <hr />
      <h1>Ticks: {count}</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return count;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Pass the `delay` to your Hook with `useCounter(delay)`. Then, inside the Hook, use `delay` instead of the hardcoded `1000` value. You'll need to add `delay` to your Effect's dependencies. This ensures that a change in `delay` will reset the interval.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(1000);
  const count = useCounter(delay);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Tick duration: {delay} ms
        <br />
        <input
          type="range"
          value={delay}
          min="10"
          max="2000"
          onChange={e => setDelay(Number(e.target.value))}
        />
      </label>
      <hr />
      <h1>Ticks: {count}</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, delay);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [delay]);
  return count;
}
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Extract `useInterval` out of `useCounter` {/*extract-useinterval-out-of-usecounter*/}

Currently, your `useCounter` Hook does two things. It sets up an interval, and it also increments a state variable on every interval tick. Split out the logic that sets up the interval into a separate Hook called `useInterval`. It should take two arguments: the `onTick` callback, and the `delay`. After this change, your `useCounter` implementation should look like this:

```js
export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, delay);
  return count;
}
```

Write `useInterval` in the `useInterval.js` file and import it into the `useCounter.js` file.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter(1000);
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, delay);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [delay]);
  return count;
}
```

```js src/useInterval.js
// Write your Hook here!
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The logic inside `useInterval` should set up and clear the interval. It doesn't need to do anything else.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter(1000);
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, delay);
  return count;
}
```

```js src/useInterval.js active
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export function useInterval(onTick, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [onTick, delay]);
}
```

</Sandpack>

Note that there is a bit of a problem with this solution, which you'll solve in the next challenge.

</Solution>

#### Fix a resetting interval {/*fix-a-resetting-interval*/}

In this example, there are *two* separate intervals.

The `App` component calls `useCounter`, which calls `useInterval` to update the counter every second. But the `App` component *also* calls `useInterval` to randomly update the page background color every two seconds.

For some reason, the callback that updates the page background never runs. Add some logs inside `useInterval`:

```js {2,5}
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('✅ Setting up an interval with delay ', delay)
    const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);
    return () => {
      console.log('❌ Clearing an interval with delay ', delay)
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [onTick, delay]);
```

Do the logs match what you expect to happen? If some of your Effects seem to re-synchronize unnecessarily, can you guess which dependency is causing that to happen? Is there some way to [remove that dependency](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) from your Effect?

After you fix the issue, you should expect the page background to update every two seconds.

<Hint>

It looks like your `useInterval` Hook accepts an event listener as an argument. Can you think of some way to wrap that event listener so that it doesn't need to be a dependency of your Effect?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter(1000);

  useInterval(() => {
    const randomColor = `hsla(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 50%, 0.2)`;
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
  }, 2000);

  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, delay);
  return count;
}
```

```js src/useInterval.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export function useInterval(onTick, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [onTick, delay]);
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Inside `useInterval`, wrap the tick callback into an Effect Event, as you did [earlier on this page.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks)

This will allow you to omit `onTick` from dependencies of your Effect. The Effect won't re-synchronize on every re-render of the component, so the page background color change interval won't get reset every second before it has a chance to fire.

With this change, both intervals work as expected and don't interfere with each other:

<Sandpack>


```js
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter(1000);

  useInterval(() => {
    const randomColor = `hsla(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 50%, 0.2)`;
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
  }, 2000);

  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

```js src/useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, delay);
  return count;
}
```

```js src/useInterval.js active
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export function useInterval(callback, delay) {
  const onTick = useEffectEvent(callback);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [delay]);
}
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Implement a staggering movement {/*implement-a-staggering-movement*/}

In this example, the `usePointerPosition()` Hook tracks the current pointer position. Try moving your cursor or your finger over the preview area and see the red dot follow your movement. Its position is saved in the `pos1` variable.

In fact, there are five (!) different red dots being rendered. You don't see them because currently they all appear at the same position. This is what you need to fix. What you want to implement instead is a "staggered" movement: each dot should "follow" the previous dot's path. For example, if you quickly move your cursor, the first dot should follow it immediately, the second dot should follow the first dot with a small delay, the third dot should follow the second dot, and so on.

You need to implement the `useDelayedValue` custom Hook. Its current implementation returns the `value` provided to it. Instead, you want to return the value back from `delay` milliseconds ago. You might need some state and an Effect to do this.

After you implement `useDelayedValue`, you should see the dots move following one another.

<Hint>

You'll need to store the `delayedValue` as a state variable inside your custom Hook. When the `value` changes, you'll want to run an Effect. This Effect should update `delayedValue` after the `delay`. You might find it helpful to call `setTimeout`.

Does this Effect need cleanup? Why or why not?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { usePointerPosition } from './usePointerPosition.js';

function useDelayedValue(value, delay) {
  // TODO: Implement this Hook
  return value;
}

export default function Canvas() {
  const pos1 = usePointerPosition();
  const pos2 = useDelayedValue(pos1, 100);
  const pos3 = useDelayedValue(pos2, 200);
  const pos4 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 100);
  const pos5 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 50);
  return (
    <>
      <Dot position={pos1} opacity={1} />
      <Dot position={pos2} opacity={0.8} />
      <Dot position={pos3} opacity={0.6} />
      <Dot position={pos4} opacity={0.4} />
      <Dot position={pos5} opacity={0.2} />
    </>
  );
}

function Dot({ position, opacity }) {
  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      opacity,
      transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      left: -20,
      top: -20,
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
    }} />
  );
}
```

```js src/usePointerPosition.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function usePointerPosition() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, []);
  return position;
}
```

```css
body { min-height: 300px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Here is a working version. You keep the `delayedValue` as a state variable. When `value` updates, your Effect schedules a timeout to update the `delayedValue`. This is why the `delayedValue` always "lags behind" the actual `value`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { usePointerPosition } from './usePointerPosition.js';

function useDelayedValue(value, delay) {
  const [delayedValue, setDelayedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setDelayedValue(value);
    }, delay);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return delayedValue;
}

export default function Canvas() {
  const pos1 = usePointerPosition();
  const pos2 = useDelayedValue(pos1, 100);
  const pos3 = useDelayedValue(pos2, 200);
  const pos4 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 100);
  const pos5 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 50);
  return (
    <>
      <Dot position={pos1} opacity={1} />
      <Dot position={pos2} opacity={0.8} />
      <Dot position={pos3} opacity={0.6} />
      <Dot position={pos4} opacity={0.4} />
      <Dot position={pos5} opacity={0.2} />
    </>
  );
}

function Dot({ position, opacity }) {
  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      opacity,
      transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      left: -20,
      top: -20,
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
    }} />
  );
}
```

```js src/usePointerPosition.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function usePointerPosition() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, []);
  return position;
}
```

```css
body { min-height: 300px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Note that this Effect *does not* need cleanup. If you called `clearTimeout` in the cleanup function, then each time the `value` changes, it would reset the already scheduled timeout. To keep the movement continuous, you want all the timeouts to fire.

title: Your First Component
---

<Intro>

*Components* are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* What a component is
* What role components play in a React application
* How to write your first React component

</YouWillLearn>

## Components: UI building blocks {/*components-ui-building-blocks*/}

On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like `<h1>` and `<li>`:

```html
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

This markup represents this article `<article>`, its heading `<h1>`, and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list `<ol>`. Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown—every piece of UI you see on the Web.

React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom "components", **reusable UI elements for your app.** The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a `<TableOfContents />` component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like `<article>`, `<h1>`, etc.

Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you're reading is made out of React components:

```js
<PageLayout>
  <NavigationHeader>
    <SearchBar />
    <Link to="/docs">Docs</Link>
  </NavigationHeader>
  <Sidebar />
  <PageContent>
    <TableOfContents />
    <DocumentationText />
  </PageContent>
</PageLayout>
```

As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with `<TableOfContents />`! You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Material UI.](https://material-ui.com/)

## Defining a component {/*defining-a-component*/}

Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: **a React component is a JavaScript function that you can _sprinkle with markup_.** Here's what that looks like (you can edit the example below):

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  )
}
```

```css
img { height: 200px; }
```

</Sandpack>

And here's how to build a component:

### Step 1: Export the component {/*step-1-export-the-component*/}

The `export default` prefix is a [standard JavaScript syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in [Importing and Exporting Components](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)!)

### Step 2: Define the function {/*step-2-define-the-function*/}

With `function Profile() { }` you define a JavaScript function with the name `Profile`.

<Pitfall>

React components are regular JavaScript functions, but **their names must start with a capital letter** or they won't work!

</Pitfall>

### Step 3: Add markup {/*step-3-add-markup*/}

The component returns an `<img />` tag with `src` and `alt` attributes. `<img />` is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.

Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component:

```js
return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
```

But if your markup isn't all on the same line as the `return` keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses:

```js
return (
  <div>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  </div>
);
```

<Pitfall>

Without parentheses, any code on the lines after `return` [will be ignored](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846283/what-are-the-rules-for-javascripts-automatic-semicolon-insertion-asi)!

</Pitfall>

## Using a component {/*using-a-component*/}

Now that you've defined your `Profile` component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a `Gallery` component that uses multiple `Profile` components:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### What the browser sees {/*what-the-browser-sees*/}

Notice the difference in casing:

* `<section>` is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.
* `<Profile />` starts with a capital `P`, so React knows that we want to use our component called `Profile`.

And `Profile` contains even more HTML: `<img />`. In the end, this is what the browser sees:

```html
<section>
  <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
</section>
```

### Nesting and organizing components {/*nesting-and-organizing-components*/}

Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move `Profile` to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the [page about imports.](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)

Because the `Profile` components are rendered inside `Gallery`—even several times!—we can say that `Gallery` is a **parent component,** rendering each `Profile` as a "child". This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.

<Pitfall>

Components can render other components, but **you must never nest their definitions:**

```js {2-5}
export default function Gallery() {
  // 🔴 Never define a component inside another component!
  function Profile() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The snippet above is [very slow and causes bugs.](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#different-components-at-the-same-position-reset-state) Instead, define every component at the top level:

```js {5-8}
export default function Gallery() {
  // ...
}

// ✅ Declare components at the top level
function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

When a child component needs some data from a parent, [pass it by props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) instead of nesting definitions.

</Pitfall>

<DeepDive>

#### Components all the way down {/*components-all-the-way-down*/}

Your React application begins at a "root" component. Usually, it is created automatically when you start a new project. For example, if you use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or if you use the framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the root component is defined in `pages/index.js`. In these examples, you've been exporting root components.

Most React apps use components all the way down. This means that you won't only use components for reusable pieces like buttons, but also for larger pieces like sidebars, lists, and ultimately, complete pages! Components are a handy way to organize UI code and markup, even if some of them are only used once.

[React-based frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app) take this a step further. Instead of using an empty HTML file and letting React "take over" managing the page with JavaScript, they *also* generate the HTML automatically from your React components. This allows your app to show some content before the JavaScript code loads.

Still, many websites only use React to [add interactivity to existing HTML pages.](/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project#using-react-for-a-part-of-your-existing-page) They have many root components instead of a single one for the entire page. You can use as much—or as little—React as you need.

</DeepDive>

<Recap>

You've just gotten your first taste of React! Let's recap some key points.

* React lets you create components, **reusable UI elements for your app.**
* In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
* React components are regular JavaScript functions except:

  1. Their names always begin with a capital letter.
  2. They return JSX markup.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Export the component {/*export-the-component*/}

This sandbox doesn't work because the root component is not exported:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/lICfvbD.jpg"
      alt="Aklilu Lemma"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
img { height: 181px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Try to fix it yourself before looking at the solution!

<Solution>

Add `export default` before the function definition like so:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/lICfvbD.jpg"
      alt="Aklilu Lemma"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
img { height: 181px; }
```

</Sandpack>

You might be wondering why writing `export` alone is not enough to fix this example. You can learn the difference between `export` and `export default` in [Importing and Exporting Components.](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)

</Solution>

#### Fix the return statement {/*fix-the-return-statement*/}

Something isn't right about this `return` statement. Can you fix it?

<Hint>

You may get an "Unexpected token" error while trying to fix this. In that case, check that the semicolon appears *after* the closing parenthesis. Leaving a semicolon inside `return ( )` will cause an error.

</Hint>


<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jA8hHMpm.jpg" alt="Katsuko Saruhashi" />;
}
```

```css
img { height: 180px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can fix this component by moving the return statement to one line like so:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jA8hHMpm.jpg" alt="Katsuko Saruhashi" />;
}
```

```css
img { height: 180px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Or by wrapping the returned JSX markup in parentheses that open right after `return`:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img 
      src="https://i.imgur.com/jA8hHMpm.jpg" 
      alt="Katsuko Saruhashi" 
    />
  );
}
```

```css
img { height: 180px; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Spot the mistake {/*spot-the-mistake*/}

Something's wrong with how the `Profile` component is declared and used. Can you spot the mistake? (Try to remember how React distinguishes components from the regular HTML tags!)

<Sandpack>

```js
function profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <profile />
      <profile />
      <profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

React component names must start with a capital letter.

Change `function profile()` to `function Profile()`, and then change every `<profile />` to `<Profile />`:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Your own component {/*your-own-component*/}

Write a component from scratch. You can give it any valid name and return any markup. If you're out of ideas, you can write a `Congratulations` component that shows `<h1>Good job!</h1>`. Don't forget to export it!

<Sandpack>

```js
// Write your component below!

```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Congratulations() {
  return (
    <h1>Good job!</h1>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

title: Importing and Exporting Components
---

<Intro>

The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* What a root component file is
* How to import and export a component
* When to use default and named imports and exports
* How to import and export multiple components from one file
* How to split components into multiple files

</YouWillLearn>

## The root component file {/*the-root-component-file*/}

In [Your First Component](/learn/your-first-component), you made a `Profile` component and a `Gallery` component that renders it:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

These currently live in a **root component file,** named `App.js` in this example. Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page.

## Exporting and importing a component {/*exporting-and-importing-a-component*/}

What if you want to change the landing screen in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move `Gallery` and `Profile` out of the root component file. This will make them more modular and reusable in other files. You can move a component in three steps:

1. **Make** a new JS file to put the components in.
2. **Export** your function component from that file (using either [default](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#using_the_default_export) or [named](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#using_named_exports) exports).
3. **Import** it in the file where you’ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing [default](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#importing_defaults) or [named](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#import_a_single_export_from_a_module) exports).

Here both `Profile` and `Gallery` have been moved out of `App.js` into a new file called `Gallery.js`. Now you can change `App.js` to import `Gallery` from `Gallery.js`:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Gallery />
  );
}
```

```js src/Gallery.js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice how this example is broken down into two component files now:

1. `Gallery.js`:
     - Defines the `Profile` component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.
     - Exports the `Gallery` component as a **default export.**
2. `App.js`:
     - Imports `Gallery` as a **default import** from `Gallery.js`.
     - Exports the root `App` component as a **default export.**


<Note>

You may encounter files that leave off the `.js` file extension like so:

```js 
import Gallery from './Gallery';
```

Either `'./Gallery.js'` or `'./Gallery'` will work with React, though the former is closer to how [native ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) work.

</Note>

<DeepDive>

#### Default vs named exports {/*default-vs-named-exports*/}

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports. So far, our examples have only used default exports. But you can use one or both of them in the same file. **A file can have no more than one _default_ export, but it can have as many _named_ exports as you like.**

![Default and named exports](/images/docs/illustrations/i_import-export.svg)

How you export your component dictates how you must import it. You will get an error if you try to import a default export the same way you would a named export! This chart can help you keep track:

| Syntax           | Export statement                           | Import statement                          |
| -----------      | -----------                                | -----------                               |
| Default  | `export default function Button() {}` | `import Button from './Button.js';`     |
| Named    | `export function Button() {}`         | `import { Button } from './Button.js';` |

When you write a _default_ import, you can put any name you want after `import`. For example, you could write `import Banana from './Button.js'` instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. That's why they are called _named_ imports!

**People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values.** Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them. Components without names, like `export default () => {}`, are discouraged because they make debugging harder.

</DeepDive>

## Exporting and importing multiple components from the same file {/*exporting-and-importing-multiple-components-from-the-same-file*/}

What if you want to show just one `Profile` instead of a gallery? You can export the `Profile` component, too. But `Gallery.js` already has a *default* export, and you can't have _two_ default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a *named* export for `Profile`. **A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports!**

<Note>

To reduce the potential confusion between default and named exports, some teams choose to only stick to one style (default or named), or avoid mixing them in a single file. Do what works best for you!

</Note>

First, **export** `Profile` from `Gallery.js` using a named export (no `default` keyword):

```js
export function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

Then, **import** `Profile` from `Gallery.js` to `App.js` using a named import (with the curly braces):

```js
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';
```

Finally, **render** `<Profile />` from the `App` component:

```js
export default function App() {
  return <Profile />;
}
```

Now `Gallery.js` contains two exports: a default `Gallery` export, and a named `Profile` export. `App.js` imports both of them. Try editing `<Profile />` to `<Gallery />` and back in this example:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Profile />
  );
}
```

```js src/Gallery.js
export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Now you're using a mix of default and named exports:

* `Gallery.js`:
  - Exports the `Profile` component as a **named export called `Profile`.**
  - Exports the `Gallery` component as a **default export.**
* `App.js`:
  - Imports `Profile` as a **named import called `Profile`** from `Gallery.js`.
  - Imports `Gallery` as a **default import** from `Gallery.js`.
  - Exports the root `App` component as a **default export.**

<Recap>

On this page you learned:

* What a root component file is
* How to import and export a component
* When and how to use default and named imports and exports
* How to export multiple components from the same file

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Split the components further {/*split-the-components-further*/}

Currently, `Gallery.js` exports both `Profile` and `Gallery`, which is a bit confusing.

Move the `Profile` component to its own `Profile.js`, and then change the `App` component to render both `<Profile />` and `<Gallery />` one after another.

You may use either a default or a named export for `Profile`, but make sure that you use the corresponding import syntax in both `App.js` and `Gallery.js`! You can refer to the table from the deep dive above:

| Syntax           | Export statement                           | Import statement                          |
| -----------      | -----------                                | -----------                               |
| Default  | `export default function Button() {}` | `import Button from './Button.js';`     |
| Named    | `export function Button() {}`         | `import { Button } from './Button.js';` |

<Hint>

Don't forget to import your components where they are called. Doesn't `Gallery` use `Profile`, too?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Profile />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/Gallery.js active
// Move me to Profile.js!
export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/Profile.js
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

After you get it working with one kind of exports, make it work with the other kind.

<Solution>

This is the solution with named exports:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Profile />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/Gallery.js
import { Profile } from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/Profile.js
export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This is the solution with default exports:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Profile />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/Gallery.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/Profile.js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"

title: Writing Markup with JSX
---

<Intro>

*JSX* is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* Why React mixes markup with rendering logic
* How JSX is different from HTML
* How to display information with JSX

</YouWillLearn>

## JSX: Putting markup into JavaScript {/*jsx-putting-markup-into-javascript*/}

The Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For many years, web developers kept content in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—often in separate files! Content was marked up inside HTML while the page's logic lived separately in JavaScript:

<DiagramGroup>

<Diagram name="writing_jsx_html" height={237} width={325} alt="HTML markup with purple background and a div with two child tags: p and form. ">

HTML

</Diagram>

<Diagram name="writing_jsx_js" height={237} width={325} alt="Three JavaScript handlers with yellow background: onSubmit, onLogin, and onClick.">

JavaScript

</Diagram>

</DiagramGroup>

But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why **in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components.**

<DiagramGroup>

<Diagram name="writing_jsx_sidebar" height={330} width={325} alt="React component with HTML and JavaScript from previous examples mixed. Function name is Sidebar which calls the function isLoggedIn, highlighted in yellow. Nested inside the function highlighted in purple is the p tag from before, and a Form tag referencing the component shown in the next diagram.">

`Sidebar.js` React component

</Diagram>

<Diagram name="writing_jsx_form" height={330} width={325} alt="React component with HTML and JavaScript from previous examples mixed. Function name is Form containing two handlers onClick and onSubmit highlighted in yellow. Following the handlers is HTML highlighted in purple. The HTML contains a form element with a nested input element, each with an onClick prop.">

`Form.js` React component

</Diagram>

</DiagramGroup>

Keeping a button's rendering logic and markup together ensures that they stay in sync with each other on every edit. Conversely, details that are unrelated, such as the button's markup and a sidebar's markup, are isolated from each other, making it safer to change either of them on their own.

Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. The best way to understand this is to convert some HTML markup to JSX markup.

<Note>

JSX and React are two separate things. They're often used together, but you *can* [use them independently](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#whats-a-jsx-transform) of each other. JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library.

</Note>

## Converting HTML to JSX {/*converting-html-to-jsx*/}

Suppose that you have some (perfectly valid) HTML:

```html
<h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
<img 
  src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
  alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
  class="photo"
>
<ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology
</ul>
```

And you want to put it into your component:

```js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    // ???
  )
}
```

If you copy and paste it as is, it will not work:


<Sandpack>

```js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    // This doesn't quite work!
    <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
    <img 
      src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
      alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
      class="photo"
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Invent new traffic lights
      <li>Rehearse a movie scene
      <li>Improve the spectrum technology
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```css
img { height: 90px }
```

</Sandpack>

This is because JSX is stricter and has a few more rules than HTML! If you read the error messages above, they'll guide you to fix the markup, or you can follow the guide below.

<Note>

Most of the time, React's on-screen error messages will help you find where the problem is. Give them a read if you get stuck!

</Note>

## The Rules of JSX {/*the-rules-of-jsx*/}

### 1. Return a single root element {/*1-return-a-single-root-element*/}

To return multiple elements from a component, **wrap them with a single parent tag.**

For example, you can use a `<div>`:

```js {1,11}
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```


If you don't want to add an extra `<div>` to your markup, you can write `<>` and `</>` instead:

```js {1,11}
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
```

This empty tag is called a *[Fragment.](/reference/react/Fragment)* Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.

<DeepDive>

#### Why do multiple JSX tags need to be wrapped? {/*why-do-multiple-jsx-tags-need-to-be-wrapped*/}

JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can't return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. This explains why you also can't return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment.

</DeepDive>

### 2. Close all the tags {/*2-close-all-the-tags*/}

JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like `<img>` must become `<img />`, and wrapping tags like `<li>oranges` must be written as `<li>oranges</li>`.

This is how Hedy Lamarr's image and list items look closed:

```js {2-6,8-10}
<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

### 3. camelCase <s>all</s> most of the things! {/*3-camelcase-salls-most-of-the-things*/}

JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can't contain dashes or be reserved words like `class`.

This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of `stroke-width` you use `strokeWidth`. Since `class` is a reserved word, in React you write `className` instead, named after the [corresponding DOM property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className):

```js {4}
<img 
  src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
  alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
  className="photo"
/>
```

You can [find all these attributes in the list of DOM component props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common) If you get one wrong, don't worry—React will print a message with a possible correction to the [browser console.](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Browser_Console)

<Pitfall>

For historical reasons, [`aria-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) and [`data-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) attributes are written as in HTML with dashes.

</Pitfall>

### Pro-tip: Use a JSX Converter {/*pro-tip-use-a-jsx-converter*/}

Converting all these attributes in existing markup can be tedious! We recommend using a [converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx) to translate your existing HTML and SVG to JSX. Converters are very useful in practice, but it's still worth understanding what is going on so that you can comfortably write JSX on your own.

Here is your final result:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
      <img 
        src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
        alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
        className="photo" 
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
        <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
        <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
img { height: 90px }
```

</Sandpack>

<Recap>

Now you know why JSX exists and how to use it in components:

* React components group rendering logic together with markup because they are related.
* JSX is similar to HTML, with a few differences. You can use a [converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx) if you need to.
* Error messages will often point you in the right direction to fixing your markup.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Convert some HTML to JSX {/*convert-some-html-to-jsx*/}

This HTML was pasted into a component, but it's not valid JSX. Fix it:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Bio() {
  return (
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="summary">
      You can find my thoughts here.
      <br><br>
      <b>And <i>pictures</b></i> of scientists!
    </p>
  );
}
```

```css
.intro {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red);
  background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}

.summary {
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid gold;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Whether to do it by hand or using the converter is up to you!

<Solution>

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Bio() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="intro">
        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      </div>
      <p className="summary">
        You can find my thoughts here.
        <br /><br />
        <b>And <i>pictures</i></b> of scientists!
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.intro {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to left, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red);
  background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}

.summary {
  padding: 20px;

title: JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces
---

<Intro>

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How to pass strings with quotes
* How to reference a JavaScript variable inside JSX with curly braces
* How to call a JavaScript function inside JSX with curly braces
* How to use a JavaScript object inside JSX with curly braces

</YouWillLearn>

## Passing strings with quotes {/*passing-strings-with-quotes*/}

When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Here, `"https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"` and `"Gregorio Y. Zara"` are being passed as strings.

But what if you want to dynamically specify the `src` or `alt` text? You could **use a value from JavaScript by replacing `"` and `"` with `{` and `}`**:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Avatar() {
  const avatar = 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg';
  const description = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={avatar}
      alt={description}
    />
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice the difference between `className="avatar"`, which specifies an `"avatar"` CSS class name that makes the image round, and `src={avatar}` that reads the value of the JavaScript variable called `avatar`. That's because curly braces let you work with JavaScript right there in your markup!

## Using curly braces: A window into the JavaScript world {/*using-curly-braces-a-window-into-the-javascript-world*/}

JSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it’s possible to use JavaScript inside it—with curly braces `{ }`. The example below first declares a name for the scientist, `name`, then embeds it with curly braces inside the `<h1>`:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function TodoList() {
  const name = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return (
    <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try changing the `name`'s value from `'Gregorio Y. Zara'` to `'Hedy Lamarr'`. See how the list title changes?

Any JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like `formatDate()`:

<Sandpack>

```js
const today = new Date();

function formatDate(date) {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat(
    'en-US',
    { weekday: 'long' }
  ).format(date);
}

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <h1>To Do List for {formatDate(today)}</h1>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

### Where to use curly braces {/*where-to-use-curly-braces*/}

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. **As text** directly inside a JSX tag: `<h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>` works, but `<{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}>`  will not.
2. **As attributes** immediately following the `=` sign: `src={avatar}` will read the `avatar` variable, but `src="{avatar}"` will pass the string `"{avatar}"`.

## Using "double curlies": CSS and other objects in JSX {/*using-double-curlies-css-and-other-objects-in-jsx*/}

In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like `{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }`. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: `person={{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }}`.

You may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the `style` attribute:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <ul style={{
      backgroundColor: 'black',
      color: 'pink'
    }}>
      <li>Improve the videophone</li>
      <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
      <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
ul { padding: 20px 20px 20px 40px; margin: 0; }
```

</Sandpack>

Try changing the values of `backgroundColor` and `color`.

You can really see the JavaScript object inside the curly braces when you write it like this:

```js {2-5}
<ul style={
  {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
}>
```

The next time you see `{{` and `}}` in JSX, know that it's nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies!

<Pitfall>

Inline `style` properties are written in camelCase. For example, HTML `<ul style="background-color: black">` would be written as `<ul style={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}>`  in your component.

</Pitfall>

## More fun with JavaScript objects and curly braces {/*more-fun-with-javascript-objects-and-curly-braces*/}

You can move several expressions into one object, and reference them in your JSX inside curly braces:

<Sandpack>

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In this example, the `person` JavaScript object contains a `name` string and a `theme` object:

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};
```

The component can use these values from `person` like so:

```js
<div style={person.theme}>
  <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
```

JSX is very minimal as a templating language because it lets you organize data and logic using JavaScript.

<Recap>

Now you know almost everything about JSX:

* JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings.
* Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.
* They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after `=` in attributes.
* `{{` and `}}` is not special syntax: it's a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces.

</Recap>

<Challenges>

#### Fix the mistake {/*fix-the-mistake*/}

This code crashes with an error saying `Objects are not valid as a React child`:

<Sandpack>

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Can you find the problem?

<Hint>Look for what's inside the curly braces. Are we putting the right thing there?</Hint>

<Solution>

This is happening because this example renders *an object itself* into the markup rather than a string: `<h1>{person}'s Todos</h1>` is trying to render the entire `person` object! Including raw objects as text content throws an error because React doesn't know how you want to display them.

To fix it, replace `<h1>{person}'s Todos</h1>` with `<h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>`:

<Sandpack>

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Extract information into an object {/*extract-information-into-an-object*/}

Extract the image URL into the `person` object.

<Sandpack>

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Move the image URL into a property called `person.imageUrl` and read it from the `<img>` tag using the curlies:

<Sandpack>

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  imageUrl: "https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg",
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={person.imageUrl}
        alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Write an expression inside JSX curly braces {/*write-an-expression-inside-jsx-curly-braces*/}

In the object below, the full image URL is split into four parts: base URL, `imageId`, `imageSize`, and file extension.

We want the image URL to combine these attributes together: base URL (always `'https://i.imgur.com/'`), `imageId` (`'7vQD0fP'`), `imageSize` (`'s'`), and file extension (always `'.jpg'`). However, something is wrong with how the `<img>` tag specifies its `src`.

Can you fix it?

<Sandpack>

```js

const baseUrl = 'https://i.imgur.com/';
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  imageId: '7vQD0fP',
  imageSize: 's',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src="{baseUrl}{person.imageId}{person.imageSize}.jpg"
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

To check that your fix worked, try changing the value of `imageSize` to `'b'`. The image should resize after your edit.

<Solution>

You can write it as `src={baseUrl + person.imageId + person.imageSize + '.jpg'}`.

1. `{` opens the JavaScript expression
2. `baseUrl + person.imageId + person.imageSize + '.jpg'` produces the correct URL string
3. `}` closes the JavaScript expression

<Sandpack>

```js
const baseUrl = 'https://i.imgur.com/';
const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  imageId: '7vQD0fP',
  imageSize: 's',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={baseUrl + person.imageId + person.imageSize + '.jpg'}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

You can also move this expression into a separate function like `getImageUrl` below:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js'

const person = {
  name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
  imageId: '7vQD0fP',
  imageSize: 's',
  theme: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
  }
};

export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <div style={person.theme}>
      <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the videophone</li>
        <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
        <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    person.imageSize +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }
body > div > div { padding: 20px; }
.avatar { border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

Variables and functions can help you keep the markup simple!

title: Passing Props to a Component
---

<Intro>

React components use *props* to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How to pass props to a component
* How to read props from a component
* How to specify default values for props
* How to pass some JSX to a component
* How props change over time

</YouWillLearn>

## Familiar props {/*familiar-props*/}

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
      alt="Lin Lanying"
      width={100}
      height={100}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar />
  );
}
```

```css
body { min-height: 120px; }
.avatar { margin: 20px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

The props you can pass to an `<img>` tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to [the HTML standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-img-element)). But you can pass any props to *your own* components, such as `<Avatar>`, to customize them. Here's how!

## Passing props to a component {/*passing-props-to-a-component*/}

In this code, the `Profile` component isn't passing any props to its child component, `Avatar`:

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar />
  );
}
```

You can give `Avatar` some props in two steps.

### Step 1: Pass props to the child component {/*step-1-pass-props-to-the-child-component*/}

First, pass some props to `Avatar`. For example, let's pass two props: `person` (an object), and `size` (a number):

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

<Note>

If double curly braces after `person=` confuse you, recall [they're merely an object](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces#using-double-curlies-css-and-other-objects-in-jsx) inside the JSX curlies.

</Note>

Now you can read these props inside the `Avatar` component.

### Step 2: Read props inside the child component {/*step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component*/}

You can read these props by listing their names `person, size` separated by the commas inside `({` and `})` directly after `function Avatar`. This lets you use them inside the `Avatar` code, like you would with a variable.

```js
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```

Add some logic to `Avatar` that uses the `person` and `size` props for rendering, and you're done.

Now you can configure `Avatar` to render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values!

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi', 
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={80}
        person={{
          name: 'Aklilu Lemma', 
          imageId: 'OKS67lh'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={50}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Lin Lanying',
          imageId: '1bX5QH6'
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
body { min-height: 120px; }
.avatar { margin: 10px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

Props let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the `person` or the `size` props inside `Profile` without having to think about how `Avatar` uses them. Similarly, you can change how the `Avatar` uses these props, without looking at the `Profile`.

You can think of props like "knobs" that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, props _are_ the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a `props` object:

```js
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
```

Usually you don't need the whole `props` object itself, so you destructure it into individual props.

<Pitfall>

**Don't miss the pair of `{` and `}` curlies** inside of `(` and `)` when declaring props:

```js
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // ...
}
```

This syntax is called ["destructuring"](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_a_function_parameter) and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:

```js
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
```

</Pitfall>

## Specifying a default value for a prop {/*specifying-a-default-value-for-a-prop*/}

If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting `=` and the default value right after the parameter:

```js
function Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) {
  // ...
}
```

Now, if `<Avatar person={...} />` is rendered with no `size` prop, the `size` will be set to `100`.

The default value is only used if the `size` prop is missing or if you pass `size={undefined}`. But if you pass `size={null}` or `size={0}`, the default value will **not** be used.

## Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax {/*forwarding-props-with-the-jsx-spread-syntax*/}

Sometimes, passing props gets very repetitive:

```js
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

There's nothing wrong with repetitive code—it can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components forward all of their props to their children, like how this `Profile` does with `Avatar`. Because they don't use any of their props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise "spread" syntax:

```js
function Profile(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This forwards all of `Profile`'s props to the `Avatar` without listing each of their names.

**Use spread syntax with restraint.** If you're using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. More on that next!

## Passing JSX as children {/*passing-jsx-as-children*/}

It is common to nest built-in browser tags:

```js
<div>
  <img />
</div>
```

Sometimes you'll want to nest your own components the same way:

```js
<Card>
  <Avatar />
</Card>
```

When you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called `children`. For example, the `Card` component below will receive a `children` prop set to `<Avatar />` and render it in a wrapper div:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import Avatar from './Avatar.js';

function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}
```

```js src/Avatar.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.card {
  width: fit-content;
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
  font-size: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: #fff;
}
.avatar {
  margin: 20px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try replacing the `<Avatar>` inside `<Card>` with some text to see how the `Card` component can wrap any nested content. It doesn't need to "know" what's being rendered inside of it. You will see this flexible pattern in many places.

You can think of a component with a `children` prop as having a "hole" that can be "filled in" by its parent components with arbitrary JSX. You will often use the `children` prop for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc.

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_children-prop.png" alt='A puzzle-like Card tile with a slot for "children" pieces like text and Avatar' />

## How props change over time {/*how-props-change-over-time*/}

The `Clock` component below receives two props from its parent component: `color` and `time`. (The parent component's code is omitted because it uses [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), which we won't dive into just yet.)

Try changing the color in the select box below:

<Sandpack>

```js src/Clock.js active
export default function Clock({ color, time }) {
  return (
    <h1 style={{ color: color }}>
      {time}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock.js';

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}

export default function App() {
  const time = useTime();
  const [color, setColor] = useState('lightcoral');
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Pick a color:{' '}
        <select value={color} onChange={e => setColor(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="lightcoral">lightcoral</option>
          <option value="midnightblue">midnightblue</option>
          <option value="rebeccapurple">rebeccapurple</option>
        </select>
      </p>
      <Clock color={color} time={time.toLocaleTimeString()} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

This example illustrates that **a component may receive different props over time.** Props are not always static! Here, the `time` prop changes every second, and the `color` prop changes when you select another color. Props reflect a component's data at any point in time, rather than only in the beginning.

However, props are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)—a term from computer science meaning "unchangeable". When a component needs to change its props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to "ask" its parent component to pass it _different props_—a new object! Its old props will then be cast aside, and eventually the JavaScript engine will reclaim the memory taken by them.

**Don't try to "change props".** When you need to respond to the user input (like changing the selected color), you will need to "set state", which you can learn about in [State: A Component's Memory.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

<Recap>

* To pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes.
* To read props, use the `function Avatar({ person, size })` destructuring syntax.
* You can specify a default value like `size = 100`, which is used for missing and `undefined` props.
* You can forward all props with `<Avatar {...props} />` JSX spread syntax, but don't overuse it!
* Nested JSX like `<Card><Avatar /></Card>` will appear as `Card` component's `children` prop.
* Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.
* You can't change props. When you need interactivity, you'll need to set state.

#### Extract a component {/*extract-a-component*/}

This `Gallery` component contains some very similar markup for two profiles. Extract a `Profile` component out of it to reduce the duplication. You'll need to choose what props to pass to it.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notable Scientists</h1>
      <section className="profile">
        <h2>Maria Skłodowska-Curie</h2>
        <img
          className="avatar"
          src={getImageUrl('szV5sdG')}
          alt="Maria Skłodowska-Curie"
          width={70}
          height={70}
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Profession: </b> 
            physicist and chemist
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Awards: 4 </b> 
            (Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Davy Medal, Matteucci Medal)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Discovered: </b>
            polonium (chemical element)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section className="profile">
        <h2>Katsuko Saruhashi</h2>
        <img
          className="avatar"
          src={getImageUrl('YfeOqp2')}
          alt="Katsuko Saruhashi"
          width={70}
          height={70}
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Profession: </b> 
            geochemist
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Awards: 2 </b> 
            (Miyake Prize for geochemistry, Tanaka Prize)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Discovered: </b>
            a method for measuring carbon dioxide in seawater
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(imageId, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 5px; border-radius: 50%; min-height: 70px; }
.profile {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
}
h1, h2 { margin: 5px; }
h1 { margin-bottom: 10px; }
ul { padding: 0px 10px 0px 20px; }
li { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Hint>

Start by extracting the markup for one of the scientists. Then find the pieces that don't match it in the second example, and make them configurable by props.

</Hint>

<Solution>

In this solution, the `Profile` component accepts multiple props: `imageId` (a string), `name` (a string), `profession` (a string), `awards` (an array of strings), `discovery` (a string), and `imageSize` (a number).

Note that the `imageSize` prop has a default value, which is why we don't pass it to the component.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function Profile({
  imageId,
  name,
  profession,
  awards,
  discovery,
  imageSize = 70
}) {
  return (
    <section className="profile">
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={getImageUrl(imageId)}
        alt={name}
        width={imageSize}
        height={imageSize}
      />
      <ul>
        <li><b>Profession:</b> {profession}</li>
        <li>
          <b>Awards: {awards.length} </b>
          ({awards.join(', ')})
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Discovered: </b>
          {discovery}
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notable Scientists</h1>
      <Profile
        imageId="szV5sdG"
        name="Maria Skłodowska-Curie"
        profession="physicist and chemist"
        discovery="polonium (chemical element)"
        awards={[
          'Nobel Prize in Physics',
          'Nobel Prize in Chemistry',
          'Davy Medal',
          'Matteucci Medal'
        ]}
      />
      <Profile
        imageId='YfeOqp2'
        name='Katsuko Saruhashi'
        profession='geochemist'
        discovery="a method for measuring carbon dioxide in seawater"
        awards={[
          'Miyake Prize for geochemistry',
          'Tanaka Prize'
        ]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(imageId, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 5px; border-radius: 50%; min-height: 70px; }
.profile {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
}
h1, h2 { margin: 5px; }
h1 { margin-bottom: 10px; }
ul { padding: 0px 10px 0px 20px; }
li { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Note how you don't need a separate `awardCount` prop if `awards` is an array. Then you can use `awards.length` to count the number of awards. Remember that props can take any values, and that includes arrays too!

Another solution, which is more similar to the earlier examples on this page, is to group all information about a person in a single object, and pass that object as one prop:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function Profile({ person, imageSize = 70 }) {
  const imageSrc = getImageUrl(person)

  return (
    <section className="profile">
      <h2>{person.name}</h2>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={imageSrc}
        alt={person.name}
        width={imageSize}
        height={imageSize}
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Profession:</b> {person.profession}
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Awards: {person.awards.length} </b>
          ({person.awards.join(', ')})

Although the syntax looks slightly different because you're describing properties of a JavaScript object rather than a collection of JSX attributes, these examples are mostly equivalent, and you can pick either approach.

</Solution>

#### Adjust the image size based on a prop {/*adjust-the-image-size-based-on-a-prop*/}

In this example, `Avatar` receives a numeric `size` prop which determines the `<img>` width and height. The `size` prop is set to `40` in this example. However, if you open the image in a new tab, you'll notice that the image itself is larger (`160` pixels). The real image size is determined by which thumbnail size you're requesting.

Change the `Avatar` component to request the closest image size based on the `size` prop. Specifically, if the `size` is less than `90`, pass `'s'` ("small") rather than `'b'` ("big") to the `getImageUrl` function. Verify that your changes work by rendering avatars with different values of the `size` prop and opening images in a new tab.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person, 'b')}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      size={40}
      person={{ 
        name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara', 
        imageId: '7vQD0fP'
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person, size) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 20px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Here is how you could go about it:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  let thumbnailSize = 's';
  if (size > 90) {
    thumbnailSize = 'b';
  }
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person, thumbnailSize)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <>
      <Avatar
        size={40}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara', 
          imageId: '7vQD0fP'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={120}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara', 
          imageId: '7vQD0fP'
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person, size) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 20px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

You could also show a sharper image for high DPI screens by taking [`window.devicePixelRatio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio) into account:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

const ratio = window.devicePixelRatio;

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  let thumbnailSize = 's';
  if (size * ratio > 90) {
    thumbnailSize = 'b';
  }
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person, thumbnailSize)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <>
      <Avatar
        size={40}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara', 
          imageId: '7vQD0fP'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={70}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara', 
          imageId: '7vQD0fP'
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={120}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara', 
          imageId: '7vQD0fP'
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person, size) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 20px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

Props let you encapsulate logic like this inside the `Avatar` component (and change it later if needed) so that everyone can use the `<Avatar>` component without thinking about how the images are requested and resized.

</Solution>

#### Passing JSX in a `children` prop {/*passing-jsx-in-a-children-prop*/}

Extract a `Card` component from the markup below, and use the `children` prop to pass different JSX to it:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="card">
        <div className="card-content">
          <h1>Photo</h1>
          <img
            className="avatar"
            src="https://i.imgur.com/OKS67lhm.jpg"
            alt="Aklilu Lemma"
            width={70}
            height={70}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="card">
        <div className="card-content">
          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Aklilu Lemma was a distinguished Ethiopian scientist who discovered a natural treatment to schistosomiasis.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.card {
  width: fit-content;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: #fff;
}
.card-content {
  text-align: center;
}
.avatar {
  margin: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
h1 {
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 0;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Hint>

Any JSX you put inside of a component's tag will be passed as the `children` prop to that component.

</Hint>

<Solution>

This is how you can use the `Card` component in both places:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <div className="card-content">
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h1>Photo</h1>
        <img
          className="avatar"
          src="https://i.imgur.com/OKS67lhm.jpg"
          alt="Aklilu Lemma"
          width={100}
          height={100}
        />
      </Card>
      <Card>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Aklilu Lemma was a distinguished Ethiopian scientist who discovered a natural treatment to schistosomiasis.</p>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.card {
  width: fit-content;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: #fff;
}
.card-content {
  text-align: center;
}
.avatar {
  margin: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
h1 {
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 0;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can also make `title` a separate prop if you want every `Card` to always have a title:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Card({ children, title }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <div className="card-content">
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card title="Photo">
        <img
          className="avatar"
          src="https://i.imgur.com/OKS67lhm.jpg"
          alt="Aklilu Lemma"
          width={100}
          height={100}
        />
      </Card>
      <Card title="About">
        <p>Aklilu Lemma was a distinguished Ethiopian scientist who discovered a natural treatment to schistosomiasis.</p>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.card {
  width: fit-content;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: #fff;
}
.card-content {
  text-align: center;
}
.avatar {
  margin: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
h1 {
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 0;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

title: Conditional Rendering
---

<Intro>

Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like `if` statements, `&&`, and `? :` operators.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How to return different JSX depending on a condition
* How to conditionally include or exclude a piece of JSX
* Common conditional syntax shortcuts you’ll encounter in React codebases

</YouWillLearn>

## Conditionally returning JSX {/*conditionally-returning-jsx*/}

Let’s say you have a `PackingList` component rendering several `Item`s, which can be marked as packed or not:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Notice that some of the `Item` components have their `isPacked` prop set to `true` instead of `false`. You want to add a checkmark (✅) to packed items if `isPacked={true}`.

You can write this as an [`if`/`else` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) like so:

```js
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className="item">{name} ✅</li>;
}
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
```

If the `isPacked` prop is `true`, this code **returns a different JSX tree.** With this change, some of the items get a checkmark at the end:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  if (isPacked) {
    return <li className="item">{name} ✅</li>;
  }
  return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try editing what gets returned in either case, and see how the result changes!

Notice how you're creating branching logic with JavaScript's `if` and `return` statements. In React, control flow (like conditions) is handled by JavaScript.

### Conditionally returning nothing with `null` {/*conditionally-returning-nothing-with-null*/}

In some situations, you won't want to render anything at all. For example, say you don't want to show packed items at all. A component must return something. In this case, you can return `null`:

```js
if (isPacked) {
  return null;
}
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
```

If `isPacked` is true, the component will return nothing, `null`. Otherwise, it will return JSX to render.

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  if (isPacked) {
    return null;
  }
  return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

In practice, returning `null` from a component isn't common because it might surprise a developer trying to render it. More often, you would conditionally include or exclude the component in the parent component's JSX. Here's how to do that!

## Conditionally including JSX {/*conditionally-including-jsx*/}

In the previous example, you controlled which (if any!) JSX tree would be returned by the component. You may already have noticed some duplication in the render output:

```js
<li className="item">{name} ✅</li>
```

is very similar to

```js
<li className="item">{name}</li>
```

Both of the conditional branches return `<li className="item">...</li>`:

```js
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className="item">{name} ✅</li>;
}
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
```

While this duplication isn't harmful, it could make your code harder to maintain. What if you want to change the `className`? You'd have to do it in two places in your code! In such a situation, you could conditionally include a little JSX to make your code more [DRY.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

### Conditional (ternary) operator (`? :`) {/*conditional-ternary-operator--*/}

JavaScript has a compact syntax for writing a conditional expression -- the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) or "ternary operator".

Instead of this:

```js
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className="item">{name} ✅</li>;
}
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
```

You can write this:

```js
return (
  <li className="item">
    {isPacked ? name + ' ✅' : name}
  </li>
);
```

You can read it as *"if `isPacked` is true, then (`?`) render `name + ' ✅'`, otherwise (`:`) render `name`"*.

<DeepDive>

#### Are these two examples fully equivalent? {/*are-these-two-examples-fully-equivalent*/}

If you're coming from an object-oriented programming background, you might assume that the two examples above are subtly different because one of them may create two different "instances" of `<li>`. But JSX elements aren't "instances" because they don't hold any internal state and aren't real DOM nodes. They're lightweight descriptions, like blueprints. So these two examples, in fact, *are* completely equivalent. [Preserving and Resetting State](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) goes into detail about how this works.

</DeepDive>

Now let's say you want to wrap the completed item's text into another HTML tag, like `<del>` to strike it out. You can add even more newlines and parentheses so that it's easier to nest more JSX in each of the cases:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {isPacked ? (
        <del>
          {name + ' ✅'}
        </del>
      ) : (
        name
      )}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

This style works well for simple conditions, but use it in moderation. If your components get messy with too much nested conditional markup, consider extracting child components to clean things up. In React, markup is a part of your code, so you can use tools like variables and functions to tidy up complex expressions.

### Logical AND operator (`&&`) {/*logical-and-operator-*/}

Another common shortcut you'll encounter is the [JavaScript logical AND (`&&`) operator.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND#:~:text=The%20logical%20AND%20(%20%26%26%20)%20operator,it%20returns%20a%20Boolean%20value.) Inside React components, it often comes up when you want to render some JSX when the condition is true, **or render nothing otherwise.** With `&&`, you could conditionally render the checkmark only if `isPacked` is `true`:

```js
return (
  <li className="item">
    {name} {isPacked && '✅'}
  </li>
);
```

You can read this as *"if `isPacked`, then (`&&`) render the checkmark, otherwise, render nothing"*.

Here it is in action:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {name} {isPacked && '✅'}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

A [JavaScript && expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) returns the value of its right side (in our case, the checkmark) if the left side (our condition) is `true`. But if the condition is `false`, the whole expression becomes `false`. React considers `false` as a "hole" in the JSX tree, just like `null` or `undefined`, and doesn't render anything in its place.


<Pitfall>

**Don't put numbers on the left side of `&&`.**

To test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is `0`, then the whole expression gets that value (`0`), and React will happily render `0` rather than nothing.

For example, a common mistake is to write code like `messageCount && <p>New messages</p>`. It's easy to assume that it renders nothing when `messageCount` is `0`, but it really renders the `0` itself!

To fix it, make the left side a boolean: `messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>`.

</Pitfall>

### Conditionally assigning JSX to a variable {/*conditionally-assigning-jsx-to-a-variable*/}

When the shortcuts get in the way of writing plain code, try using an `if` statement and a variable. You can reassign variables defined with [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), so start by providing the default content you want to display, the name:

```js
let itemContent = name;
```

Use an `if` statement to reassign a JSX expression to `itemContent` if `isPacked` is `true`:

```js
if (isPacked) {
  itemContent = name + " ✅";
}
```

[Curly braces open the "window into JavaScript".](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces#using-curly-braces-a-window-into-the-javascript-world) Embed the variable with curly braces in the returned JSX tree, nesting the previously calculated expression inside of JSX:

```js
<li className="item">
  {itemContent}
</li>
```

This style is the most verbose, but it's also the most flexible. Here it is in action:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  let itemContent = name;
  if (isPacked) {
    itemContent = name + " ✅";
  }
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {itemContent}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Like before, this works not only for text, but for arbitrary JSX too:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  let itemContent = name;
  if (isPacked) {
    itemContent = (
      <del>
        {name + " ✅"}
      </del>
    );
  }
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {itemContent}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

If you're not familiar with JavaScript, this variety of styles might seem overwhelming at first. However, learning them will help you read and write any JavaScript code -- and not just React components! Pick the one you prefer for a start, and then consult this reference again if you forget how the other ones work.

<Recap>

* In React, you control branching logic with JavaScript.
* You can return a JSX expression conditionally with an `if` statement.
* You can conditionally save some JSX to a variable and then include it inside other JSX by using the curly braces.
* In JSX, `{cond ? <A /> : <B />}` means *"if `cond`, render `<A />`, otherwise `<B />`"*.
* In JSX, `{cond && <A />}` means *"if `cond`, render `<A />`, otherwise nothing"*.
* The shortcuts are common, but you don't have to use them if you prefer plain `if`.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Show an icon for incomplete items with `? :` {/*show-an-icon-for-incomplete-items-with--*/}

Use the conditional operator (`cond ? a : b`) to render a ❌ if `isPacked` isn’t `true`.

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {name} {isPacked && '✅'}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {name} {isPacked ? '✅' : '❌'}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={true} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          isPacked={false} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Show the item importance with `&&` {/*show-the-item-importance-with-*/}

In this example, each `Item` receives a numerical `importance` prop. Use the `&&` operator to render "_(Importance: X)_" in italics, but only for items that have non-zero importance. Your item list should end up looking like this:

* Space suit _(Importance: 9)_
* Helmet with a golden leaf
* Photo of Tam _(Importance: 6)_

Don't forget to add a space between the two labels!

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, importance }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {name}
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          importance={9} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          importance={0} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          importance={6} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

This should do the trick:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Item({ name, importance }) {
  return (
    <li className="item">
      {name}
      {importance > 0 && ' '}
      {importance > 0 &&
        <i>(Importance: {importance})</i>
      }
    </li>
  );
}

export default function PackingList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
      <ul>
        <Item 
          importance={9} 
          name="Space suit" 
        />
        <Item 
          importance={0} 
          name="Helmet with a golden leaf" 
        />
        <Item 
          importance={6} 
          name="Photo of Tam" 
        />
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Note that you must write `importance > 0 && ...` rather than `importance && ...` so that if the `importance` is `0`, `0` isn't rendered as the result!

In this solution, two separate conditions are used to insert a space between the name and the importance label. Alternatively, you could use a Fragment with a leading space: `importance > 0 && <> <i>...</i></>` or add a space immediately inside the `<i>`:  `importance > 0 && <i> ...</i>`.

</Solution>

#### Refactor a series of `? :` to `if` and variables {/*refactor-a-series-of---to-if-and-variables*/}

This `Drink` component uses a series of `? :` conditions to show different information depending on whether the `name` prop is `"tea"` or `"coffee"`. The problem is that the information about each drink is spread across multiple conditions. Refactor this code to use a single `if` statement instead of three `? :` conditions.

<Sandpack>

```js
function Drink({ name }) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <dl>
        <dt>Part of plant</dt>
        <dd>{name === 'tea' ? 'leaf' : 'bean'}</dd>
        <dt>Caffeine content</dt>
        <dd>{name === 'tea' ? '15–70 mg/cup' : '80–185 mg/cup'}</dd>
        <dt>Age</dt>
        <dd>{name === 'tea' ? '4,000+ years' : '1,000+ years'}</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
  );
}

export default function DrinkList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Drink name="tea" />
      <Drink name="coffee" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Once you've refactored the code to use `if`, do you have further ideas on how to simplify it?

<Solution>

There are multiple ways you could go about this, but here is one starting point:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Drink({ name }) {
  let part, caffeine, age;
  if (name === 'tea') {
    part = 'leaf';
    caffeine = '15–70 mg/cup';
    age = '4,000+ years';
  } else if (name === 'coffee') {
    part = 'bean';
    caffeine = '80–185 mg/cup';
    age = '1,000+ years';
  }
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <dl>
        <dt>Part of plant</dt>
        <dd>{part}</dd>
        <dt>Caffeine content</dt>
        <dd>{caffeine}</dd>
        <dt>Age</dt>
        <dd>{age}</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
  );
}

export default function DrinkList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Drink name="tea" />
      <Drink name="coffee" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Here the information about each drink is grouped together instead of being spread across multiple conditions. This makes it easier to add more drinks in the future.

Another solution would be to remove the condition altogether by moving the information into objects:

<Sandpack>

```js
const drinks = {
  tea: {
    part: 'leaf',
    caffeine: '15–70 mg/cup',
    age: '4,000+ years'
  },
  coffee: {
    part: 'bean',
    caffeine: '80–185 mg/cup',
    age: '1,000+ years'
  }
};

function Drink({ name }) {
  const info = drinks[name];
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <dl>
        <dt>Part of plant</dt>
        <dd>{info.part}</dd>
        <dt>Caffeine content</dt>
        <dd>{info.caffeine}</dd>
        <dt>Age</dt>
        <dd>{info.age}</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
  );
}

export default function DrinkList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Drink name="tea" />
      <Drink name="coffee" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

title: Rendering Lists
---

<Intro>

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use the [JavaScript array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#) to manipulate an array of data. On this page, you'll use [`filter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and [`map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How to render components from an array using JavaScript's `map()`
* How to render only specific components using JavaScript's `filter()`
* When and why to use React keys

</YouWillLearn>

## Rendering data from arrays {/*rendering-data-from-arrays*/}

Say that you have a list of content.

```js
<ul>
  <li>Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician</li>
  <li>Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist</li>
  <li>Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist</li>
  <li>Percy Lavon Julian: chemist</li>
  <li>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist</li>
</ul>
```

The only difference among those list items is their contents, their data. You will often need to show several instances of the same component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of comments to galleries of profile images. In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like [`map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [`filter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) to render lists of components from them.

Here’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:

1. **Move** the data into an array:

```js
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];
```

2. **Map** the `people` members into a new array of JSX nodes, `listItems`:

```js
const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);
```

3. **Return** `listItems` from your component wrapped in a `<ul>`:

```js
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

Here is the result:

<Sandpack>

```js
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person =>
    <li>{person}</li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

```css
li { margin-bottom: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice the sandbox above displays a console error:

<ConsoleBlock level="error">

Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

</ConsoleBlock>

You'll learn how to fix this error later on this page. Before we get to that, let's add some structure to your data.

## Filtering arrays of items {/*filtering-arrays-of-items*/}

This data can be structured even more.

```js
const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
}, {
  id: 3,
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',  
}, {
  id: 4,
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
}];
```

Let's say you want a way to only show people whose profession is `'chemist'`. You can use JavaScript's `filter()` method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a “test” (a function that returns `true` or `false`), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned `true`).

You only want the items where `profession` is `'chemist'`. The "test" function for this looks like `(person) => person.profession === 'chemist'`. Here's how to put it together:

1. **Create** a new array of just “chemist” people, `chemists`, by calling `filter()` on the `people` filtering by `person.profession === 'chemist'`:

```js
const chemists = people.filter(person =>
  person.profession === 'chemist'
);
```

2. Now **map** over `chemists`:

```js {1,13}
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>
     <img
       src={getImageUrl(person)}
       alt={person.name}
     />
     <p>
       <b>{person.name}:</b>
       {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
       known for {person.accomplishment}
     </p>
  </li>
);
```

3. Lastly, **return** the `listItems` from your component:

```js
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession === 'chemist'
  );
  const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
    <li>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2,

}, {
  id: 3,

  profession: 'chemist',

  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4,
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0px 10px; }
li { 
  margin-bottom: 10px; 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
}
img { width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Pitfall>

Arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after `=>`, so you didn't need a `return` statement:

```js
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>...</li> // Implicit return!
);
```

However, **you must write `return` explicitly if your `=>` is followed by a `{` curly brace!**

```js
const listItems = chemists.map(person => { // Curly brace
  return <li>...</li>;
});
```

Arrow functions containing `=> {` are said to have a ["block body".](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#function_body) They let you write more than a single line of code, but you *have to* write a `return` statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!

</Pitfall>

## Keeping list items in order with `key` {/*keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key*/}

Notice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console:

<ConsoleBlock level="error">

Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

</ConsoleBlock>

You need to give each array item a `key` -- a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:

```js
<li key={person.id}>...</li>
```

<Note>

JSX elements directly inside a `map()` call always need keys!

</Note>

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen `key` helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

Rather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person =>
    <li key={person.id}>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}</b>
          {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
          known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

```js src/data.js active
export const people = [{
  id: 0, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0px 10px; }
li { 
  margin-bottom: 10px; 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
}
img { width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

<DeepDive>

#### Displaying several DOM nodes for each list item {/*displaying-several-dom-nodes-for-each-list-item*/}

What do you do when each item needs to render not one, but several DOM nodes?

The short [`<>...</>` Fragment](/reference/react/Fragment) syntax won't let you pass a key, so you need to either group them into a single `<div>`, or use the slightly longer and [more explicit `<Fragment>` syntax:](/reference/react/Fragment#rendering-a-list-of-fragments)

```js
import { Fragment } from 'react';

// ...

const listItems = people.map(person =>
  <Fragment key={person.id}>
    <h1>{person.name}</h1>
    <p>{person.bio}</p>
  </Fragment>
);
```

Fragments disappear from the DOM, so this will produce a flat list of `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and so on.

</DeepDive>

### Where to get your `key` {/*where-to-get-your-key*/}

Different sources of data provide different sources of keys:

* **Data from a database:** If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.
* **Locally generated data:** If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, [`crypto.randomUUID()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID) or a package like [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) when creating items.

### Rules of keys {/*rules-of-keys*/}

* **Keys must be unique among siblings.** However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in _different_ arrays.
* **Keys must not change** or that defeats their purpose! Don't generate them while rendering.

### Why does React need keys? {/*why-does-react-need-keys*/}

Imagine that files on your desktop didn't have names. Instead, you'd refer to them by their order -- the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.

File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the _position_ changes due to reordering, the `key` lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.

<Pitfall>

You might be tempted to use an item's index in the array as its key. In fact, that's what React will use if you don't specify a `key` at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.

Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with `key={Math.random()}`. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.

Note that your components won't receive `key` as a prop. It's only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: `<Profile key={id} userId={id} />`.

</Pitfall>

<Recap>

On this page you learned:

* How to move data out of components and into data structures like arrays and objects.
* How to generate sets of similar components with JavaScript's `map()`.
* How to create arrays of filtered items with JavaScript's `filter()`.
* Why and how to set `key` on each component in a collection so React can keep track of each of them even if their position or data changes.

#### Splitting a list in two {/*splitting-a-list-in-two*/}

This example shows a list of all people.

Change it to show two separate lists one after another: **Chemists** and **Everyone Else.** Like previously, you can determine whether a person is a chemist by checking if `person.profession === 'chemist'`.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person =>
    <li key={person.id}>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Scientists</h1>
      <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    </article>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3,
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4,
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0px 10px; }
li {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
}
img { width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You could use `filter()` twice, creating two separate arrays, and then `map` over both of them:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession === 'chemist'
  );
  const everyoneElse = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession !== 'chemist'
  );
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Scientists</h1>
      <h2>Chemists</h2>
      <ul>
        {chemists.map(person =>
          <li key={person.id}>
            <img
              src={getImageUrl(person)}
              alt={person.name}
            />
            <p>
              <b>{person.name}:</b>
              {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
              known for {person.accomplishment}
            </p>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
      <h2>Everyone Else</h2>
      <ul>
        {everyoneElse.map(person =>
          <li key={person.id}>
            <img
              src={getImageUrl(person)}
              alt={person.name}
            />
            <p>
              <b>{person.name}:</b>
              {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
              known for {person.accomplishment}
            </p>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </article>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3,
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4,
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0px 10px; }
li {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
}
img { width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

In this solution, the `map` calls are placed directly inline into the parent `<ul>` elements, but you could introduce variables for them if you find that more readable.

There is still a bit duplication between the rendered lists. You can go further and extract the repetitive parts into a `<ListSection>` component:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

function ListSection({ title, people }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <ul>
        {people.map(person =>
          <li key={person.id}>
            <img
              src={getImageUrl(person)}
              alt={person.name}
            />
            <p>
              <b>{person.name}:</b>
              {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
              known for {person.accomplishment}
            </p>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession === 'chemist'
  );
  const everyoneElse = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession !== 'chemist'
  );
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Scientists</h1>
      <ListSection
        title="Chemists"
        people={chemists}
      />
      <ListSection
        title="Everyone Else"
        people={everyoneElse}
      />
    </article>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',

}];
```

```js src/utils.js
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0px 10px; }

  margin-bottom: 10px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;

  align-items: center;
}
img { width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%; }
```

</Sandpack>

A very attentive reader might notice that with two `filter` calls, we check each person's profession twice. Checking a property is very fast, so in this example it's fine. If your logic was more expensive than that, you could replace the `filter` calls with a loop that manually constructs the arrays and checks each person once.

In fact, if `people` never change, you could move this code out of your component. From React's perspective, all that matters is that you give it an array of JSX nodes in the end. It doesn't care how you produce that array:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

let chemists = [];
let everyoneElse = [];
people.forEach(person => {
  if (person.profession === 'chemist') {
    chemists.push(person);
  } else {
    everyoneElse.push(person);
  }
});

function ListSection({ title, people }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <ul>
        {people.map(person =>
          <li key={person.id}>
            <img
              src={getImageUrl(person)}
              alt={person.name}
            />
            <p>
              <b>{person.name}:</b>
              {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
              known for {person.accomplishment}
            </p>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export default function List() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Scientists</h1>
      <ListSection
        title="Chemists"
        people={chemists}
      />
      <ListSection
        title="Everyone Else"
        people={everyoneElse}
      />
    </article>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const people = [{

#### Nested lists in one component {/*nested-lists-in-one-component*/}

Make a list of recipes from this array! For each recipe in the array, display its name as an `<h2>` and list its ingredients in a `<ul>`.

<Hint>

This will require nesting two different `map` calls.

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { recipes } from './data.js';

export default function RecipeList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const recipes = [{
  id: 'greek-salad',
  name: 'Greek Salad',
  ingredients: ['tomatoes', 'cucumber', 'onion', 'olives', 'feta']
}, {
  id: 'hawaiian-pizza',
  name: 'Hawaiian Pizza',
  ingredients: ['pizza crust', 'pizza sauce', 'mozzarella', 'ham', 'pineapple']
}, {
  id: 'hummus',
  name: 'Hummus',
  ingredients: ['chickpeas', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'lemon', 'tahini']
}];
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Here is one way you could go about it:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { recipes } from './data.js';

export default function RecipeList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
      {recipes.map(recipe =>
        <div key={recipe.id}>
          <h2>{recipe.name}</h2>
          <ul>
            {recipe.ingredients.map(ingredient =>
              <li key={ingredient}>
                {ingredient}
              </li>
            )}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const recipes = [{
  id: 'greek-salad',
  name: 'Greek Salad',
  ingredients: ['tomatoes', 'cucumber', 'onion', 'olives', 'feta']
}, {
  id: 'hawaiian-pizza',
  name: 'Hawaiian Pizza',
  ingredients: ['pizza crust', 'pizza sauce', 'mozzarella', 'ham', 'pineapple']
}, {
  id: 'hummus',
  name: 'Hummus',
  ingredients: ['chickpeas', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'lemon', 'tahini']
}];
```

</Sandpack>

Each of the `recipes` already includes an `id` field, so that's what the outer loop uses for its `key`. There is no ID you could use to loop over ingredients. However, it's reasonable to assume that the same ingredient won't be listed twice within the same recipe, so its name can serve as a `key`. Alternatively, you could change the data structure to add IDs, or use index as a `key` (with the caveat that you can't safely reorder ingredients).

</Solution>

#### Extracting a list item component {/*extracting-a-list-item-component*/}

This `RecipeList` component contains two nested `map` calls. To simplify it, extract a `Recipe` component from it which will accept `id`, `name`, and `ingredients` props. Where do you place the outer `key` and why?

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { recipes } from './data.js';

export default function RecipeList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
      {recipes.map(recipe =>
        <div key={recipe.id}>
          <h2>{recipe.name}</h2>
          <ul>
            {recipe.ingredients.map(ingredient =>
              <li key={ingredient}>
                {ingredient}
              </li>
            )}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const recipes = [{
  id: 'greek-salad',
  name: 'Greek Salad',
  ingredients: ['tomatoes', 'cucumber', 'onion', 'olives', 'feta']
}, {
  id: 'hawaiian-pizza',
  name: 'Hawaiian Pizza',
  ingredients: ['pizza crust', 'pizza sauce', 'mozzarella', 'ham', 'pineapple']
}, {
  id: 'hummus',
  name: 'Hummus',
  ingredients: ['chickpeas', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'lemon', 'tahini']
}];
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can copy-paste the JSX from the outer `map` into a new `Recipe` component and return that JSX. Then you can change `recipe.name` to `name`, `recipe.id` to `id`, and so on, and pass them as props to the `Recipe`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { recipes } from './data.js';

function Recipe({ id, name, ingredients }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <ul>
        {ingredients.map(ingredient =>
          <li key={ingredient}>
            {ingredient}
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function RecipeList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
      {recipes.map(recipe =>
        <Recipe {...recipe} key={recipe.id} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js src/data.js
export const recipes = [{
  id: 'greek-salad',
  name: 'Greek Salad',
  ingredients: ['tomatoes', 'cucumber', 'onion', 'olives', 'feta']
}, {
  id: 'hawaiian-pizza',
  name: 'Hawaiian Pizza',
  ingredients: ['pizza crust', 'pizza sauce', 'mozzarella', 'ham', 'pineapple']
}, {
  id: 'hummus',
  name: 'Hummus',
  ingredients: ['chickpeas', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'lemon', 'tahini']
}];
```

</Sandpack>

Here, `<Recipe {...recipe} key={recipe.id} />` is a syntax shortcut saying "pass all properties of the `recipe` object as props to the `Recipe` component". You could also write each prop explicitly: `<Recipe id={recipe.id} name={recipe.name} ingredients={recipe.ingredients} key={recipe.id} />`.

**Note that the `key` is specified on the `<Recipe>` itself rather than on the root `<div>` returned from `Recipe`.** This is because this `key` is needed directly within the context of the surrounding array. Previously, you had an array of `<div>`s so each of them needed a `key`, but now you have an array of `<Recipe>`s. In other words, when you extract a component, don't forget to leave the `key` outside the JSX you copy and paste.

</Solution>

#### List with a separator {/*list-with-a-separator*/}

This example renders a famous haiku by Tachibana Hokushi, with each line wrapped in a `<p>` tag. Your job is to insert an `<hr />` separator between each paragraph. Your resulting structure should look like this:

```js
<article>
  <p>I write, erase, rewrite</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Erase again, and then</p>
  <hr />
  <p>A poppy blooms.</p>
</article>
```

A haiku only contains three lines, but your solution should work with any number of lines. Note that `<hr />` elements only appear *between* the `<p>` elements, not in the beginning or the end!

<Sandpack>

```js
const poem = {
  lines: [
    'I write, erase, rewrite',
    'Erase again, and then',
    'A poppy blooms.'
  ]
};

export default function Poem() {
  return (
    <article>
      {poem.lines.map((line, index) =>
        <p key={index}>
          {line}
        </p>
      )}
    </article>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
}
p {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-style: italic;
}
hr {
  margin: 0 120px 0 120px;
  border: 1px dashed #45c3d8;
}
```

</Sandpack>

(This is a rare case where index as a key is acceptable because a poem's lines will never reorder.)

<Hint>

You'll either need to convert `map` to a manual loop, or use a Fragment.

</Hint>

<Solution>

You can write a manual loop, inserting `<hr />` and `<p>...</p>` into the output array as you go:

<Sandpack>

```js
const poem = {
  lines: [
    'I write, erase, rewrite',
    'Erase again, and then',
    'A poppy blooms.'
  ]
};

export default function Poem() {
  let output = [];

  // Fill the output array
  poem.lines.forEach((line, i) => {
    output.push(
      <hr key={i + '-separator'} />
    );
    output.push(
      <p key={i + '-text'}>
        {line}
      </p>
    );
  });
  // Remove the first <hr />
  output.shift();

  return (
    <article>
      {output}
    </article>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
}
p {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-style: italic;
}
hr {
  margin: 0 120px 0 120px;
  border: 1px dashed #45c3d8;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Using the original line index as a `key` doesn't work anymore because each separator and paragraph are now in the same array. However, you can give each of them a distinct key using a suffix, e.g. `key={i + '-text'}`.

Alternatively, you could render a collection of Fragments which contain `<hr />` and `<p>...</p>`. However, the `<>...</>` shorthand syntax doesn't support passing keys, so you'd have to write `<Fragment>` explicitly:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { Fragment } from 'react';

const poem = {
  lines: [
    'I write, erase, rewrite',
    'Erase again, and then',
    'A poppy blooms.'
  ]
};

export default function Poem() {
  return (
    <article>
      {poem.lines.map((line, i) =>
        <Fragment key={i}>
          {i > 0 && <hr />}
          <p>{line}</p>
        </Fragment>
      )}
    </article>
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
}
p {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-style: italic;
}
hr {
  margin: 0 120px 0 120px;
  border: 1px dashed #45c3d8;
}

title: Keeping Components Pure
---

<Intro>

Some JavaScript functions are *pure.* Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more. By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. To get these benefits, though, there are a few rules you must follow.

</Intro>

* What purity is and how it helps you avoid bugs
* How to keep components pure by keeping changes out of the render phase
* How to use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components

</YouWillLearn>

## Purity: Components as formulas {/*purity-components-as-formulas*/}

In computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), [a pure function](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) is a function with the following characteristics:

* **It minds its own business.** It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
* **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.

You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas in math.

Consider this math formula: <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math>.

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 2</Math> then <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 4</Math>. Always. 

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math> then <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 6</Math>. Always. 

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math>, <MathI>y</MathI> won't sometimes be <Math>9</Math> or <Math>–1</Math> or <Math>2.5</Math> depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market. 

If <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> and <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math>, <MathI>y</MathI> will _always_ be <Math>6</Math>. 

If we made this into a JavaScript function, it would look like this:

```js
function double(number) {
  return 2 * number;
}
```

In the above example, `double` is a **pure function.** If you pass it `3`, it will return `6`. Always.

React is designed around this concept. **React assumes that every component you write is a pure function.** This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
function Recipe({ drinkers }) {
  return (
    <ol>    
      <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li>
      <li>Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.</li>
      <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Spiced Chai Recipe</h1>
      <h2>For two</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={2} />
      <h2>For a gathering</h2>
      <Recipe drinkers={4} />
    </section>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

When you pass `drinkers={2}` to `Recipe`, it will return JSX containing `2 cups of water`. Always. 

If you pass `drinkers={4}`, it will return JSX containing `4 cups of water`. Always.

Just like a math formula. 

You could think of your components as recipes: if you follow them and don't introduce new ingredients during the cooking process, you will get the same dish every time. That "dish" is the JSX that the component serves to React to [render.](/learn/render-and-commit)

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_puritea-recipe.png" alt="A tea recipe for x people: take x cups of water, add x spoons of tea and 0.5x spoons of spices, and 0.5x cups of milk" />

## Side Effects: (un)intended consequences {/*side-effects-unintended-consequences*/}

React's rendering process must always be pure. Components should only *return* their JSX, and not *change* any objects or variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure!

Here is a component that breaks this rule:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [5]}}
let guest = 0;

function Cup() {
  // Bad: changing a preexisting variable!
  guest = guest + 1;
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

This component is reading and writing a `guest` variable declared outside of it. This means that **calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX!** And what's more, if _other_ components read `guest`, they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered! That's not predictable.

Going back to our formula <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math>, now even if <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 2</Math>, we cannot trust that <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 4</Math>. Our tests could fail, our users would be baffled, planes would fall out of the sky—you can see how this would lead to confusing bugs!

You can fix this component by [passing `guest` as a prop instead](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component):

<Sandpack>

```js
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup guest={1} />
      <Cup guest={2} />
      <Cup guest={3} />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Now your component is pure, as the JSX it returns only depends on the `guest` prop.

In general, you should not expect your components to be rendered in any particular order. It doesn't matter if you call <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> before or after <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 5<MathI>x</MathI></Math>: both formulas will resolve independently of each other. In the same way, each component should only "think for itself", and not attempt to coordinate with or depend upon others during rendering. Rendering is like a school exam: each component should calculate JSX on their own!

<DeepDive>

#### Detecting impure calculations with StrictMode {/*detecting-impure-calculations-with-strict-mode*/}

Although you might not have used them all yet, in React there are three kinds of inputs that you can read while rendering: [props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component), [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), and [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) You should always treat these inputs as read-only.

When you want to *change* something in response to user input, you should [set state](/learn/state-a-components-memory) instead of writing to a variable. You should never change preexisting variables or objects while your component is rendering.

React offers a "Strict Mode" in which it calls each component's function twice during development. **By calling the component functions twice, Strict Mode helps find components that break these rules.**

Notice how the original example displayed "Guest #2", "Guest #4", and "Guest #6" instead of "Guest #1", "Guest #2", and "Guest #3". The original function was impure, so calling it twice broke it. But the fixed pure version works even if the function is called twice every time. **Pure functions only calculate, so calling them twice won't change anything**--just like calling `double(2)` twice doesn't change what's returned, and solving <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> twice doesn't change what <MathI>y</MathI> is. Same inputs, same outputs. Always.

Strict Mode has no effect in production, so it won't slow down the app for your users. To opt into Strict Mode, you can wrap your root component into `<React.StrictMode>`. Some frameworks do this by default.

</DeepDive>

### Local mutation: Your component's little secret {/*local-mutation-your-components-little-secret*/}

In the above example, the problem was that the component changed a *preexisting* variable while rendering. This is often called a **"mutation"** to make it sound a bit scarier. Pure functions don't mutate variables outside of the function's scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure!

However, **it's completely fine to change variables and objects that you've *just* created while rendering.** In this example, you create an `[]` array, assign it to a `cups` variable, and then `push` a dozen cups into it:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Cup({ guest }) {
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaGathering() {
  const cups = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
    cups.push(<Cup key={i} guest={i} />);
  }
  return cups;
}
```

</Sandpack>

If the `cups` variable or the `[]` array were created outside the `TeaGathering` function, this would be a huge problem! You would be changing a *preexisting* object by pushing items into that array.

However, it's fine because you've created them *during the same render*, inside `TeaGathering`. No code outside of `TeaGathering` will ever know that this happened. This is called **"local mutation"**—it's like your component's little secret.

## Where you _can_ cause side effects {/*where-you-_can_-cause-side-effects*/}

While functional programming relies heavily on purity, at some point, somewhere, _something_ has to change. That's kind of the point of programming! These changes—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—are called **side effects.** They're things that happen _"on the side"_, not during rendering.

In React, **side effects usually belong inside [event handlers.](/learn/responding-to-events)** Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined *inside* your component, they don't run *during* rendering! **So event handlers don't need to be pure.**

If you've exhausted all other options and can't find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. **However, this approach should be your last resort.**

When possible, try to express your logic with rendering alone. You'll be surprised how far this can take you!

<DeepDive>

#### Why does React care about purity? {/*why-does-react-care-about-purity*/}

Writing pure functions takes some habit and discipline. But it also unlocks marvelous opportunities:

* Your components could run in a different environment—for example, on the server! Since they return the same result for the same inputs, one component can serve many user requests.
* You can improve performance by [skipping rendering](/reference/react/memo) components whose inputs have not changed. This is safe because pure functions always return the same results, so they are safe to cache.
* If some data changes in the middle of rendering a deep component tree, React can restart rendering without wasting time to finish the outdated render. Purity makes it safe to stop calculating at any time.

Every new React feature we're building takes advantage of purity. From data fetching to animations to performance, keeping components pure unlocks the power of the React paradigm.

</DeepDive>

<Recap>

* A component must be pure, meaning:
  * **It minds its own business.** It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering.
  * **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. 
* Rendering can happen at any time, so components should not depend on each others' rendering sequence.
* You should not mutate any of the inputs that your components use for rendering. That includes props, state, and context. To update the screen, ["set" state](/learn/state-a-components-memory) instead of mutating preexisting objects.
* Strive to express your component's logic in the JSX you return. When you need to "change things", you'll usually want to do it in an event handler. As a last resort, you can `useEffect`.
* Writing pure functions takes a bit of practice, but it unlocks the power of React's paradigm.

#### Fix a broken clock {/*fix-a-broken-clock*/}

This component tries to set the `<h1>`'s CSS class to `"night"` during the time from midnight to six hours in the morning, and `"day"` at all other times. However, it doesn't work. Can you fix this component?

You can verify whether your solution works by temporarily changing the computer's timezone. When the current time is between midnight and six in the morning, the clock should have inverted colors!

<Hint>

Rendering is a *calculation*, it shouldn't try to "do" things. Can you express the same idea differently?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/Clock.js active
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  const hours = time.getHours();
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    document.getElementById('time').className = 'night';
  } else {
    document.getElementById('time').className = 'day';
  }
  return (
    <h1 id="time">
      {time.toLocaleTimeString()}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock.js';

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}

export default function App() {
  const time = useTime();
  return (
    <Clock time={time} />
  );
}
```

```css
body > * {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
.day {
  background: #fff;
  color: #222;
}
.night {
  background: #222;
  color: #fff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can fix this component by calculating the `className` and including it in the render output:

<Sandpack>

```js src/Clock.js active
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  const hours = time.getHours();
  let className;
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    className = 'night';
  } else {
    className = 'day';
  }
  return (
    <h1 className={className}>
      {time.toLocaleTimeString()}
    </h1>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock.js';

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}

export default function App() {
  const time = useTime();
  return (
    <Clock time={time} />
  );
}
```

```css
body > * {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
.day {
  background: #fff;
  color: #222;
}
.night {
  background: #222;
  color: #fff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In this example, the side effect (modifying the DOM) was not necessary at all. You only needed to return JSX.

#### Fix a broken profile {/*fix-a-broken-profile*/}

Two `Profile` components are rendered side by side with different data. Press "Collapse" on the first profile, and then "Expand" it. You'll notice that both profiles now show the same person. This is a bug.

Find the cause of the bug and fix it.

<Hint>

The buggy code is in `Profile.js`. Make sure you read it all from top to bottom!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [7]}} src/Profile.js
import Panel from './Panel.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

let currentPerson;

export default function Profile({ person }) {
  currentPerson = person;
  return (
    <Panel>
      <Header />
      <Avatar />
    </Panel>
  )
}

function Header() {
  return <h1>{currentPerson.name}</h1>;
}

function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(currentPerson)}
      alt={currentPerson.name}
      width={50}
      height={50}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/Panel.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Panel({ children }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
        {open ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
      </button>
      {open && children}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'lrWQx8l',
        name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
      }} />
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'MK3eW3A',
        name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
      }} />
    </>
  )
}
```

```js src/utils.js hidden
export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 5px; border-radius: 50%; }
.panel {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}
h1 { margin: 5px; font-size: 18px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The problem is that the `Profile` component writes to a preexisting variable called `currentPerson`, and the `Header` and `Avatar` components read from it. This makes *all three of them* impure and difficult to predict.

To fix the bug, remove the `currentPerson` variable. Instead, pass all information from `Profile` to `Header` and `Avatar` via props. You'll need to add a `person` prop to both components and pass it all the way down.

<Sandpack>

```js src/Profile.js active
import Panel from './Panel.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function Profile({ person }) {
  return (
    <Panel>
      <Header person={person} />
      <Avatar person={person} />
    </Panel>
  )
}

function Header({ person }) {
  return <h1>{person.name}</h1>;
}

function Avatar({ person }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={50}
      height={50}
    />
  );
}
```

```js src/Panel.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Panel({ children }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
        {open ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
      </button>
      {open && children}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'lrWQx8l',
        name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
      }} />
      <Profile person={{
        imageId: 'MK3eW3A',
        name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
      }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/utils.js hidden
export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    size +
    '.jpg'
  );
}
```

```css
.avatar { margin: 5px; border-radius: 50%; }
.panel {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}
h1 { margin: 5px; font-size: 18px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Remember that React does not guarantee that component functions will execute in any particular order, so you can't communicate between them by setting variables. All communication must happen through props.

#### Fix a broken story tray {/*fix-a-broken-story-tray*/}

The CEO of your company is asking you to add "stories" to your online clock app, and you can't say no. You've written a `StoryTray` component that accepts a list of `stories`, followed by a "Create Story" placeholder.

You implemented the "Create Story" placeholder by pushing one more fake story at the end of the `stories` array that you receive as a prop. But for some reason, "Create Story" appears more than once. Fix the issue.

<Sandpack>

```js src/StoryTray.js active
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  stories.push({
    id: 'create',
    label: 'Create Story'
  });

  return (
    <ul>
      {stories.map(story => (
        <li key={story.id}>
          {story.label}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}} src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StoryTray from './StoryTray.js';

const initialStories = [
  {id: 0, label: "Ankit's Story" },
  {id: 1, label: "Taylor's Story" },
];

export default function App() {
  const [stories, setStories] = useState([...initialStories])
  const time = useTime();

  // HACK: Prevent the memory from growing forever while you read docs.
  // We're breaking our own rules here.
  if (stories.length > 100) {
    stories.length = 100;
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()} now.</h2>
      <StoryTray stories={stories} />
    </div>
  );
}

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

```css
ul {
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

```js sandbox.config.json hidden
{
  "hardReloadOnChange": true
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Notice how whenever the clock updates, "Create Story" is added *twice*. This serves as a hint that we have a mutation during rendering--Strict Mode calls components twice to make these issues more noticeable.

`StoryTray` function is not pure. By calling `push` on the received `stories` array (a prop!), it is mutating an object that was created *before* `StoryTray` started rendering. This makes it buggy and very difficult to predict.

The simplest fix is to not touch the array at all, and render "Create Story" separately:

<Sandpack>

```js src/StoryTray.js active
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {stories.map(story => (
        <li key={story.id}>
          {story.label}
        </li>
      ))}
      <li>Create Story</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}} src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StoryTray from './StoryTray.js';

const initialStories = [
  {id: 0, label: "Ankit's Story" },
  {id: 1, label: "Taylor's Story" },
];

export default function App() {
  const [stories, setStories] = useState([...initialStories])
  const time = useTime();

  // HACK: Prevent the memory from growing forever while you read docs.
  // We're breaking our own rules here.
  if (stories.length > 100) {
    stories.length = 100;
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()} now.</h2>
      <StoryTray stories={stories} />
    </div>
  );
}

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

```css
ul {
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Alternatively, you could create a _new_ array (by copying the existing one) before you push an item into it:

<Sandpack>

```js src/StoryTray.js active
export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  // Copy the array!
  const storiesToDisplay = stories.slice();

  // Does not affect the original array:
  storiesToDisplay.push({
    id: 'create',
    label: 'Create Story'
  });

  return (
    <ul>
      {storiesToDisplay.map(story => (
        <li key={story.id}>
          {story.label}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [16]}} src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StoryTray from './StoryTray.js';

const initialStories = [
  {id: 0, label: "Ankit's Story" },
  {id: 1, label: "Taylor's Story" },
];

export default function App() {
  const [stories, setStories] = useState([...initialStories])
  const time = useTime();

  // HACK: Prevent the memory from growing forever while you read docs.
  // We're breaking our own rules here.
  if (stories.length > 100) {
    stories.length = 100;
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()} now.</h2>
      <StoryTray stories={stories} />
    </div>
  );
}

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}
```

```css
ul {
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  float: left;
  margin: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

This keeps your mutation local and your rendering function pure. However, you still need to be careful: for example, if you tried to change any of the array's existing items, you'd have to clone those items too.

It is useful to remember which operations on arrays mutate them, and which don't. For example, `push`, `pop`, `reverse`, and `sort` will mutate the original array, but `slice`, `filter`, and `map` will create a new one.

title: Understanding Your UI as a Tree
---

<Intro>

Your React app is taking shape with many components being nested within each other. How does React keep track of your app's component structure?

React, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree. Thinking of your app as a tree is useful for understanding the relationship between components. This understanding will help you debug future concepts like performance and state management.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How React "sees" component structures
* What a render tree is and what it is useful for
* What a module dependency tree is and what it is useful for

</YouWillLearn>

## Your UI as a tree {/*your-ui-as-a-tree*/}

Trees are a relationship model between items. The UI is often represented using tree structures. For example, browsers use tree structures to model HTML ([DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)) and CSS ([CSSOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model)). Mobile platforms also use trees to represent their view hierarchy.

<Diagram name="preserving_state_dom_tree" height={193} width={864} alt="Diagram with three sections arranged horizontally. In the first section, there are three rectangles stacked vertically, with labels 'Component A', 'Component B', and 'Component C'. Transitioning to the next pane is an arrow with the React logo on top labeled 'React'. The middle section contains a tree of components, with the root labeled 'A' and two children labeled 'B' and 'C'. The next section is again transitioned using an arrow with the React logo on top labeled 'React DOM'. The third and final section is a wireframe of a browser, containing a tree of 8 nodes, which has only a subset highlighted (indicating the subtree from the middle section).">

React creates a UI tree from your components. In this example, the UI tree is then used to render to the DOM.
</Diagram>

Like browsers and mobile platforms, React also uses tree structures to manage and model the relationship between components in a React app. These trees are useful tools to understand how data flows through a React app and how to optimize rendering and app size.

## The Render Tree {/*the-render-tree*/}

A major feature of components is the ability to compose components of other components. As we [nest components](/learn/your-first-component#nesting-and-organizing-components), we have the concept of parent and child components, where each parent component may itself be a child of another component.

When we render a React app, we can model this relationship in a tree, known as the render tree.

Here is a React app that renders inspirational quotes.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import FancyText from './FancyText';
import InspirationGenerator from './InspirationGenerator';
import Copyright from './Copyright';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <FancyText title text="Get Inspired App" />
      <InspirationGenerator>
        <Copyright year={2004} />
      </InspirationGenerator>
    </>
  );
}

```

```js src/FancyText.js
export default function FancyText({title, text}) {
  return title
    ? <h1 className='fancy title'>{text}</h1>
    : <h3 className='fancy cursive'>{text}</h3>
}
```

```js src/InspirationGenerator.js
import * as React from 'react';
import quotes from './quotes';
import FancyText from './FancyText';

export default function InspirationGenerator({children}) {
  const [index, setIndex] = React.useState(0);
  const quote = quotes[index];
  const next = () => setIndex((index + 1) % quotes.length);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Your inspirational quote is:</p>
      <FancyText text={quote} />
      <button onClick={next}>Inspire me again</button>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/Copyright.js
export default function Copyright({year}) {
  return <p className='small'>©️ {year}</p>;
}
```

```js src/quotes.js
export default [
  "Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.” — Will Rogers",
  "Ambition is putting a ladder against the sky.",
  "A joy that's shared is a joy made double.",
  ];
```

```css
.fancy {
  font-family: 'Georgia';
}
.title {
  color: #007AA3;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
.cursive {
  font-style: italic;
}
.small {
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Diagram name="render_tree" height={250} width={500} alt="Tree graph with five nodes. Each node represents a component. The root of the tree is App, with two arrows extending from it to 'InspirationGenerator' and 'FancyText'. The arrows are labelled with the word 'renders'. 'InspirationGenerator' node also has two arrows pointing to nodes 'FancyText' and 'Copyright'.">

React creates a *render tree*, a UI tree, composed of the rendered components.


</Diagram>

From the example app, we can construct the above render tree.

The tree is composed of nodes, each of which represents a component. `App`, `FancyText`, `Copyright`, to name a few, are all nodes in our tree.

The root node in a React render tree is the [root component](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components#the-root-component-file) of the app. In this case, the root component is `App` and it is the first component React renders. Each arrow in the tree points from a parent component to a child component.

<DeepDive>

#### Where are the HTML tags in the render tree? {/*where-are-the-html-elements-in-the-render-tree*/}

You'll notice in the above render tree, there is no mention of the HTML tags that each component renders. This is because the render tree is only composed of React [components](learn/your-first-component#components-ui-building-blocks).

React, as a UI framework, is platform agnostic. On react.dev, we showcase examples that render to the web, which uses HTML markup as its UI primitives. But a React app could just as likely render to a mobile or desktop platform, which may use different UI primitives like [UIView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview) or [FrameworkElement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.frameworkelement?view=windowsdesktop-7.0).

These platform UI primitives are not a part of React. React render trees can provide insight to our React app regardless of what platform your app renders to.

</DeepDive>

A render tree represents a single render pass of a React application. With [conditional rendering](/learn/conditional-rendering), a parent component may render different children depending on the data passed.

We can update the app to conditionally render either an inspirational quote or color.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import FancyText from './FancyText';
import InspirationGenerator from './InspirationGenerator';
import Copyright from './Copyright';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <FancyText title text="Get Inspired App" />
      <InspirationGenerator>
        <Copyright year={2004} />
      </InspirationGenerator>
    </>
  );
}

```

```js src/FancyText.js
export default function FancyText({title, text}) {
  return title
    ? <h1 className='fancy title'>{text}</h1>
    : <h3 className='fancy cursive'>{text}</h3>
}
```

```js src/Color.js
export default function Color({value}) {
  return <div className="colorbox" style={{backgroundColor: value}} />
}
```

```js src/InspirationGenerator.js
import * as React from 'react';
import inspirations from './inspirations';
import FancyText from './FancyText';
import Color from './Color';

export default function InspirationGenerator({children}) {
  const [index, setIndex] = React.useState(0);
  const inspiration = inspirations[index];
  const next = () => setIndex((index + 1) % inspirations.length);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Your inspirational {inspiration.type} is:</p>
      {inspiration.type === 'quote'
      ? <FancyText text={inspiration.value} />
      : <Color value={inspiration.value} />}

      <button onClick={next}>Inspire me again</button>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/Copyright.js
export default function Copyright({year}) {
  return <p className='small'>©️ {year}</p>;
}
```

```js src/inspirations.js
export default [
  {type: 'quote', value: "Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.” — Will Rogers"},
  {type: 'color', value: "#B73636"},
  {type: 'quote', value: "Ambition is putting a ladder against the sky."},
  {type: 'color', value: "#256266"},
  {type: 'quote', value: "A joy that's shared is a joy made double."},
  {type: 'color', value: "#F9F2B4"},
];
```

```css
.fancy {
  font-family: 'Georgia';
}
.title {
  color: #007AA3;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
.cursive {
  font-style: italic;
}
.small {
  font-size: 10px;
}
.colorbox {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  margin: 8px;
}
```
</Sandpack>

<Diagram name="conditional_render_tree" height={250} width={561} alt="Tree graph with six nodes. The top node of the tree is labelled 'App' with two arrows extending to nodes labelled 'InspirationGenerator' and 'FancyText'. The arrows are solid lines and are labelled with the word 'renders'. 'InspirationGenerator' node also has three arrows. The arrows to nodes 'FancyText' and 'Color' are dashed and labelled with 'renders?'. The last arrow points to the node labelled 'Copyright' and is solid and labelled with 'renders'.">

With conditional rendering, across different renders, the render tree may render different components.

</Diagram>

In this example, depending on what `inspiration.type` is, we may render `<FancyText>` or `<Color>`. The render tree may be different for each render pass.

Although render trees may differ across render passes, these trees are generally helpful for identifying what the *top-level* and *leaf components* are in a React app. Top-level components are the components nearest to the root component and affect the rendering performance of all the components beneath them and often contain the most complexity. Leaf components are near the bottom of the tree and have no child components and are often frequently re-rendered.

Identifying these categories of components are useful for understanding data flow and performance of your app.

## The Module Dependency Tree {/*the-module-dependency-tree*/}

Another relationship in a React app that can be modeled with a tree are an app's module dependencies. As we [break up our components](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components#exporting-and-importing-a-component) and logic into separate files, we create [JS modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) where we may export components, functions, or constants.

Each node in a module dependency tree is a module and each branch represents an `import` statement in that module.

If we take the previous Inspirations app, we can build a module dependency tree, or dependency tree for short.

<Diagram name="module_dependency_tree" height={250} width={658} alt="A tree graph with seven nodes. Each node is labelled with a module name. The top level node of the tree is labelled 'App.js'. There are three arrows pointing to the modules 'InspirationGenerator.js', 'FancyText.js' and 'Copyright.js' and the arrows are labelled with 'imports'. From the 'InspirationGenerator.js' node, there are three arrows that extend to three modules: 'FancyText.js', 'Color.js', and 'inspirations.js'. The arrows are labelled with 'imports'.">

The module dependency tree for the Inspirations app.

</Diagram>

The root node of the tree is the root module, also known as the entrypoint file. It often is the module that contains the root component.

Comparing to the render tree of the same app, there are similar structures but some notable differences:

* The nodes that make-up the tree represent modules, not components.
* Non-component modules, like `inspirations.js`, are also represented in this tree. The render tree only encapsulates components.
* `Copyright.js` appears under `App.js` but in the render tree, `Copyright`, the component, appears as a child of `InspirationGenerator`. This is because `InspirationGenerator` accepts JSX as [children props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children), so it renders `Copyright` as a child component but does not import the module.

Dependency trees are useful to determine what modules are necessary to run your React app. When building a React app for production, there is typically a build step that will bundle all the necessary JavaScript to ship to the client. The tool responsible for this is called a [bundler](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview#the_modern_tooling_ecosystem), and bundlers will use the dependency tree to determine what modules should be included.

As your app grows, often the bundle size does too. Large bundle sizes are expensive for a client to download and run. Large bundle sizes can delay the time for your UI to get drawn. Getting a sense of your app's dependency tree may help with debugging these issues.

[comment]: <> (perhaps we should also deep dive on conditional imports)

<Recap>

* Trees are a common way to represent the relationship between entities. They are often used to model UI.
* Render trees represent the nested relationship between React components across a single render.
* With conditional rendering, the render tree may change across different renders. With different prop values, components may render different children components.
* Render trees help identify what the top-level and leaf components are. Top-level components affect the rendering performance of all components beneath them and leaf components are often re-rendered frequently. Identifying them is useful for understanding and debugging rendering performance.
* Dependency trees represent the module dependencies in a React app.
* Dependency trees are used by build tools to bundle the necessary code to ship an app.
* Dependency trees are useful for debugging large bundle sizes that slow time to paint and expose opportunities for optimizing what code is bundled.

title: Responding to Events
---

<Intro>

React lets you add *event handlers* to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* Different ways to write an event handler
* How to pass event handling logic from a parent component
* How events propagate and how to stop them

</YouWillLearn>

## Adding event handlers {/*adding-event-handlers*/}

To add an event handler, you will first define a function and then [pass it as a prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) to the appropriate JSX tag. For example, here is a button that doesn't do anything yet:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Button() {
  return (
    <button>
      I don't do anything
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can make it show a message when a user clicks by following these three steps:

1. Declare a function called `handleClick` *inside* your `Button` component.
2. Implement the logic inside that function (use `alert` to show the message).
3. Add `onClick={handleClick}` to the `<button>` JSX.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-right: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

You defined the `handleClick` function and then [passed it as a prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) to `<button>`.  `handleClick` is an **event handler.** Event handler functions:

* Are usually defined *inside* your components.
* Have names that start with `handle`, followed by the name of the event.

By convention, it is common to name event handlers as `handle` followed by the event name. You'll often see `onClick={handleClick}`, `onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}`, and so on.

Alternatively, you can define an event handler inline in the JSX:

```jsx
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

Or, more concisely, using an arrow function:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

All of these styles are equivalent. Inline event handlers are convenient for short functions.

<Pitfall>

Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called. For example:

| passing a function (correct)     | calling a function (incorrect)     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `<button onClick={handleClick}>` | `<button onClick={handleClick()}>` |

The difference is subtle. In the first example, the `handleClick` function is passed as an `onClick` event handler. This tells React to remember it and only call your function when the user clicks the button.

In the second example, the `()` at the end of `handleClick()` fires the function *immediately* during [rendering](/learn/render-and-commit), without any clicks. This is because JavaScript inside the [JSX `{` and `}`](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) executes right away.

When you write code inline, the same pitfall presents itself in a different way:

| passing a function (correct)            | calling a function (incorrect)    |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<button onClick={() => alert('...')}>` | `<button onClick={alert('...')}>` |


Passing inline code like this won't fire on click—it fires every time the component renders:

```jsx
// This alert fires when the component renders, not when clicked!
<button onClick={alert('You clicked me!')}>
```

If you want to define your event handler inline, wrap it in an anonymous function like so:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>
```

Rather than executing the code inside with every render, this creates a function to be called later.

In both cases, what you want to pass is a function:

* `<button onClick={handleClick}>` passes the `handleClick` function.
* `<button onClick={() => alert('...')}>` passes the `() => alert('...')` function.

[Read more about arrow functions.](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics)

</Pitfall>

### Reading props in event handlers {/*reading-props-in-event-handlers*/}

Because event handlers are declared inside of a component, they have access to the component's props. Here is a button that, when clicked, shows an alert with its `message` prop:

<Sandpack>

```js
function AlertButton({ message, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => alert(message)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AlertButton message="Playing!">
        Play Movie
      </AlertButton>
      <AlertButton message="Uploading!">
        Upload Image
      </AlertButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-right: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This lets these two buttons show different messages. Try changing the messages passed to them.

### Passing event handlers as props {/*passing-event-handlers-as-props*/}

Often you'll want the parent component to specify a child's event handler. Consider buttons: depending on where you're using a `Button` component, you might want to execute a different function—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image. 

To do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler like so:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

function PlayButton({ movieName }) {
  function handlePlayClick() {
    alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`);
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>
      Play "{movieName}"
    </Button>
  );
}

function UploadButton() {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
      Upload Image
    </Button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PlayButton movieName="Kiki's Delivery Service" />
      <UploadButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-right: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Here, the `Toolbar` component renders a `PlayButton` and an `UploadButton`:

- `PlayButton` passes `handlePlayClick` as the `onClick` prop to the `Button` inside.
- `UploadButton` passes `() => alert('Uploading!')` as the `onClick` prop to the `Button` inside.

Finally, your `Button` component accepts a prop called `onClick`. It passes that prop directly to the built-in browser `<button>` with `onClick={onClick}`. This tells React to call the passed function on click.

If you use a [design system](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969), it's common for components like buttons to contain styling but not specify behavior. Instead, components like `PlayButton` and `UploadButton` will pass event handlers down.

### Naming event handler props {/*naming-event-handler-props*/}

Built-in components like `<button>` and `<div>` only support [browser event names](/reference/react-dom/components/common#common-props) like `onClick`. However, when you're building your own components, you can name their event handler props any way that you like.

By convention, event handler props should start with `on`, followed by a capital letter.

For example, the `Button` component's `onClick` prop could have been called `onSmash`:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Button({ onSmash, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onSmash}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-right: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

In this example, `<button onClick={onSmash}>` shows that the browser `<button>` (lowercase) still needs a prop called `onClick`, but the prop name received by your custom `Button` component is up to you!

When your component supports multiple interactions, you might name event handler props for app-specific concepts. For example, this `Toolbar` component receives `onPlayMovie` and `onUploadImage` event handlers:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Toolbar
      onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing!')}
      onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading!')}
    />
  );
}

function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-right: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice how the `App` component does not need to know *what* `Toolbar` will do with `onPlayMovie` or `onUploadImage`. That's an implementation detail of the `Toolbar`. Here, `Toolbar` passes them down as `onClick` handlers to its `Button`s, but it could later also trigger them on a keyboard shortcut. Naming props after app-specific interactions like `onPlayMovie` gives you the flexibility to change how they're used later.
  
<Note>

Make sure that you use the appropriate HTML tags for your event handlers. For example, to handle clicks, use [`<button onClick={handleClick}>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) instead of `<div onClick={handleClick}>`. Using a real browser `<button>` enables built-in browser behaviors like keyboard navigation. If you don't like the default browser styling of a button and want to make it look more like a link or a different UI element, you can achieve it with CSS. [Learn more about writing accessible markup.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
  
</Note>

## Event propagation {/*event-propagation*/}

Event handlers will also catch events from any children your component might have. We say that an event "bubbles" or "propagates" up the tree: it starts with where the event happened, and then goes up the tree.

This `<div>` contains two buttons. Both the `<div>` *and* each button have their own `onClick` handlers. Which handlers do you think will fire when you click a button?

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() => {
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.Toolbar {
  background: #aaa;
  padding: 5px;
}
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

If you click on either button, its `onClick` will run first, followed by the parent `<div>`'s `onClick`. So two messages will appear. If you click the toolbar itself, only the parent `<div>`'s `onClick` will run.

<Pitfall>

All events propagate in React except `onScroll`, which only works on the JSX tag you attach it to.

</Pitfall>

### Stopping propagation {/*stopping-propagation*/}

Event handlers receive an **event object** as their only argument. By convention, it's usually called `e`, which stands for "event". You can use this object to read information about the event.

That event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent an event from reaching parent components, you need to call `e.stopPropagation()` like this `Button` component does:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() => {
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.Toolbar {
  background: #aaa;
  padding: 5px;
}
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

When you click on a button:

1. React calls the `onClick` handler passed to `<button>`. 
2. That handler, defined in `Button`, does the following:
   * Calls `e.stopPropagation()`, preventing the event from bubbling further.
   * Calls the `onClick` function, which is a prop passed from the `Toolbar` component.
3. That function, defined in the `Toolbar` component, displays the button's own alert.
4. Since the propagation was stopped, the parent `<div>`'s `onClick` handler does *not* run.

As a result of `e.stopPropagation()`, clicking on the buttons now only shows a single alert (from the `<button>`) rather than the two of them (from the `<button>` and the parent toolbar `<div>`). Clicking a button is not the same thing as clicking the surrounding toolbar, so stopping the propagation makes sense for this UI.

<DeepDive>

#### Capture phase events {/*capture-phase-events*/}

In rare cases, you might need to catch all events on child elements, *even if they stopped propagation*. For example, maybe you want to log every click to analytics, regardless of the propagation logic. You can do this by adding `Capture` at the end of the event name:

```js
<div onClickCapture={() => { /* this runs first */ }}>
  <button onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} />
  <button onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} />
</div>
```

Each event propagates in three phases: 

1. It travels down, calling all `onClickCapture` handlers.
2. It runs the clicked element's `onClick` handler. 
3. It travels upwards, calling all `onClick` handlers.

Capture events are useful for code like routers or analytics, but you probably won't use them in app code.

</DeepDive>

### Passing handlers as alternative to propagation {/*passing-handlers-as-alternative-to-propagation*/}

Notice how this click handler runs a line of code _and then_ calls the `onClick` prop passed by the parent:

```js {4,5}
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

You could add more code to this handler before calling the parent `onClick` event handler, too. This pattern provides an *alternative* to propagation. It lets the child component handle the event, while also letting the parent component specify some additional behavior. Unlike propagation, it's not automatic. But the benefit of this pattern is that you can clearly follow the whole chain of code that executes as a result of some event.

If you rely on propagation and it's difficult to trace which handlers execute and why, try this approach instead.

### Preventing default behavior {/*preventing-default-behavior*/}

Some browser events have default behavior associated with them. For example, a `<form>` submit event, which happens when a button inside of it is clicked, will reload the whole page by default:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Signup() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={() => alert('Submitting!')}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-left: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

You can call `e.preventDefault()` on the event object to stop this from happening:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Signup() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('Submitting!');
    }}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-left: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Don't confuse `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()`. They are both useful, but are unrelated:

* [`e.stopPropagation()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) stops the event handlers attached to the tags above from firing.
* [`e.preventDefault()` ](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) prevents the default browser behavior for the few events that have it.

## Can event handlers have side effects? {/*can-event-handlers-have-side-effects*/}

Absolutely! Event handlers are the best place for side effects.

Unlike rendering functions, event handlers don't need to be [pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure), so it's a great place to *change* something—for example, change an input's value in response to typing, or change a list in response to a button press. However, in order to change some information, you first need some way to store it. In React, this is done by using [state, a component's memory.](/learn/state-a-components-memory) You will learn all about it on the next page.

<Recap>

* You can handle events by passing a function as a prop to an element like `<button>`.
* Event handlers must be passed, **not called!** `onClick={handleClick}`, not `onClick={handleClick()}`.
* You can define an event handler function separately or inline.
* Event handlers are defined inside a component, so they can access props.
* You can declare an event handler in a parent and pass it as a prop to a child.
* You can define your own event handler props with application-specific names.
* Events propagate upwards. Call `e.stopPropagation()` on the first argument to prevent that.
* Events may have unwanted default browser behavior. Call `e.preventDefault()` to prevent that.
* Explicitly calling an event handler prop from a child handler is a good alternative to propagation.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Fix an event handler {/*fix-an-event-handler*/}

Clicking this button is supposed to switch the page background between white and black. However, nothing happens when you click it. Fix the problem. (Don't worry about the logic inside `handleClick`—that part is fine.)

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [5, 7]}}
export default function LightSwitch() {
  function handleClick() {
    let bodyStyle = document.body.style;
    if (bodyStyle.backgroundColor === 'black') {
      bodyStyle.backgroundColor = 'white';
    } else {
      bodyStyle.backgroundColor = 'black';
    }
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick()}>
      Toggle the lights
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The problem is that `<button onClick={handleClick()}>` _calls_ the `handleClick` function while rendering instead of _passing_ it. Removing the `()` call so that it's `<button onClick={handleClick}>` fixes the issue:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function LightSwitch() {
  function handleClick() {
    let bodyStyle = document.body.style;
    if (bodyStyle.backgroundColor === 'black') {
      bodyStyle.backgroundColor = 'white';
    } else {
      bodyStyle.backgroundColor = 'black';
    }
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Toggle the lights
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Alternatively, you could wrap the call into another function, like `<button onClick={() => handleClick()}>`:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function LightSwitch() {
  function handleClick() {
    let bodyStyle = document.body.style;
    if (bodyStyle.backgroundColor === 'black') {
      bodyStyle.backgroundColor = 'white';
    } else {
      bodyStyle.backgroundColor = 'black';
    }
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => handleClick()}>
      Toggle the lights
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Wire up the events {/*wire-up-the-events*/}

This `ColorSwitch` component renders a button. It's supposed to change the page color. Wire it up to the `onChangeColor` event handler prop it receives from the parent so that clicking the button changes the color.

After you do this, notice that clicking the button also increments the page click counter. Your colleague who wrote the parent component insists that `onChangeColor` does not increment any counters. What else might be happening? Fix it so that clicking the button *only* changes the color, and does _not_ increment the counter.

<Sandpack>

```js src/ColorSwitch.js active
export default function ColorSwitch({
  onChangeColor
}) {
  return (
    <button>
      Change color
    </button>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import ColorSwitch from './ColorSwitch.js';

export default function App() {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);

  function handleClickOutside() {
    setClicks(c => c + 1);
  }

  function getRandomLightColor() {
    let r = 150 + Math.round(100 * Math.random());
    let g = 150 + Math.round(100 * Math.random());
    let b = 150 + Math.round(100 * Math.random());
    return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
  }

  function handleChangeColor() {
    let bodyStyle = document.body.style;
    bodyStyle.backgroundColor = getRandomLightColor();
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} onClick={handleClickOutside}>
      <ColorSwitch onChangeColor={handleChangeColor} />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Clicks on the page: {clicks}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

First, you need to add the event handler, like `<button onClick={onChangeColor}>`.

However, this introduces the problem of the incrementing counter. If `onChangeColor` does not do this, as your colleague insists, then the problem is that this event propagates up, and some handler above does it. To solve this problem, you need to stop the propagation. But don't forget that you should still call `onChangeColor`.

<Sandpack>

```js src/ColorSwitch.js active
export default function ColorSwitch({
  onChangeColor
}) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onChangeColor();
    }}>
      Change color
    </button>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState } from 'react';
import ColorSwitch from './ColorSwitch.js';

export default function App() {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);

  function handleClickOutside() {
    setClicks(c => c + 1);
  }

  function getRandomLightColor() {
    let r = 150 + Math.round(100 * Math.random());
    let g = 150 + Math.round(100 * Math.random());
    let b = 150 + Math.round(100 * Math.random());
    return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
  }

  function handleChangeColor() {
    let bodyStyle = document.body.style;
    bodyStyle.backgroundColor = getRandomLightColor();
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} onClick={handleClickOutside}>
      <ColorSwitch onChangeColor={handleChangeColor} />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Clicks on the page: {clicks}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

title: "State: A Component's Memory"

<Intro>

Components often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking "next" on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking "buy" should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to "remember" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called *state*.

</Intro>

## When a regular variable isn’t enough {/*when-a-regular-variable-isnt-enough*/}

Here's a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the "Next" button should show the next sculpture by changing the `index` to `1`, then `2`, and so on. However, this **won't work** (you can try it!):

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (

        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <h3>

The `handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:

1. **Local variables don't persist between renders.** When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn't consider any changes to the local variables.
2. **Changes to local variables won't trigger renders.** React doesn't realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:

1. **Retain** the data between renders.
2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

The [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) Hook provides those two things:

1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

## Adding a state variable {/*adding-a-state-variable*/}

To add a state variable, import `useState` from React at the top of the file:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

Then, replace this line:

```js
let index = 0;
```

with

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` is a state variable and `setIndex` is the setter function.

> The `[` and `]` syntax here is called [array destructuring](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by `useState` always has exactly two items.

This is how they work together in `handleClick`:

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

Now clicking the "Next" button switches the current sculpture:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i>

      </h2>
      <h3>

      <img

### Meet your first Hook {/*meet-your-first-hook*/}

In React, `useState`, as well as any other function starting with "`use`", is called a Hook.

*Hooks* are special functions that are only available while React is [rendering](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) (which we'll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you "hook into" different React features.

State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.

<Pitfall>

**Hooks—functions starting with `use`—can only be called at the top level of your components or [your own Hooks.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** You can't call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it's helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component's needs. You "use" React features at the top of your component similar to how you "import" modules at the top of your file.

</Pitfall>

### Anatomy of `useState` {/*anatomy-of-usestate*/}

When you call [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

In this case, you want React to remember `index`.

<Note>

The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.

</Note>

The only argument to `useState` is the **initial value** of your state variable. In this example, the `index`'s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`. 

Every time your component renders, `useState` gives you an array containing two values:

1. The **state variable** (`index`) with the value you stored.
2. The **state setter function** (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

Here's how that happens in action:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **Your component renders the first time.** Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
2. **You update the state.** When a user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it's `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and triggers another render.
3. **Your component's second render.** React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React *remembers* that you set `index` to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.
4. And so on!

## Giving a component multiple state variables {/*giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables*/}

You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number `index` and a boolean `showMore` that's toggled when you click "Show details":

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (

It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it's more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read [Choosing the State Structure](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) for more tips.

#### How does React know which state to return? {/*how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return*/}

You might have noticed that the `useState` call does not receive any information about *which* state variable it refers to. There is no "identifier" that is passed to `useState`, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.

Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks **rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.** This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above ("only call Hooks at the top level"), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) catches most mistakes.

Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in [React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

This example **doesn't use React** but it gives you an idea of how `useState` works internally:

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,
    // so the state pair already exists.
    // Return it and prepare for next Hook call.
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // This is the first time we're rendering,
  // so create a state pair and store it.
  pair = [initialState, setState];

  function setState(nextState) {
    // When the user requests a state change,
    // put the new value into the pair.
    pair[0] = nextState;
    updateDOM();
  }

  // Store the pair for future renders
  // and prepare for the next Hook call.
  componentHooks[currentHookIndex] = pair;
  currentHookIndex++;
  return pair;
}

function Gallery() {
  // Each useState() call will get the next pair.
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  // This example doesn't use React, so
  // return an output object instead of JSX.
  return {
    onNextClick: handleNextClick,
    onMoreClick: handleMoreClick,
    header: `${sculpture.name} by ${sculpture.artist}`,
    counter: `${index + 1} of ${sculptureList.length}`,
    more: `${showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details`,
    description: showMore ? sculpture.description : null,
    imageSrc: sculpture.url,
    imageAlt: sculpture.alt
  };
}

function updateDOM() {
  // Reset the current Hook index
  // before rendering the component.
  currentHookIndex = 0;
  let output = Gallery();

  // Update the DOM to match the output.
  // This is the part React does for you.
  nextButton.onclick = output.onNextClick;
  header.textContent = output.header;
  moreButton.onclick = output.onMoreClick;
  moreButton.textContent = output.more;
  image.src = output.imageSrc;
  image.alt = output.imageAlt;
  if (output.description !== null) {
    description.textContent = output.description;
    description.style.display = '';

## State is isolated and private {/*state-is-isolated-and-private*/}

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:

<Sandpack>

```js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}

```

```js src/Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

      <h3>

      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}

This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's "local" to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn't "know" anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to *remove* state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in [Sharing State Between Components.](/learn/sharing-state-between-components)

<Recap>

* Use a state variable when a component needs to "remember" some information between renders.
* State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
* Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you "hook into" React features like state.
* Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
* The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
* You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
* State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

#### Complete the gallery {/*complete-the-gallery*/}

When you press "Next" on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.

After fixing the crash, add a "Previous" button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn't crash on the first sculpture.

</Sandpack>

Notice how `hasPrev` and `hasNext` are used *both* for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions ["close over"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) any variables declared while rendering.

</Solution>

#### Fix stuck form inputs {/*fix-stuck-form-inputs*/}

When you type into the input fields, nothing appears. It's like the input values are "stuck" with empty strings. The `value` of the first `<input>` is set to always match the `firstName` variable, and the `value` for the second `<input>` is set to always match the `lastName` variable. This is correct. Both inputs have `onChange` event handlers, which try to update the variables based on the latest user input (`e.target.value`). However, the variables don't seem to "remember" their values between re-renders. Fix this by using state variables instead.

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [6]}}
export default function Form() {
  let firstName = '';
  let lastName = '';

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleReset() {
    firstName = '';
    lastName = '';
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

First, import `useState` from React. Then replace `firstName` and `lastName` with state variables declared by calling `useState`. Finally, replace every `firstName = ...` assignment with `setFirstName(...)`, and do the same for `lastName`. Don't forget to update `handleReset` too so that the reset button works.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

</Solution>

#### Fix a crash {/*fix-a-crash*/}

Here is a small form that is supposed to let the user leave some feedback. When the feedback is submitted, it's supposed to display a thank-you message. However, it crashes with an error message saying "Rendered fewer hooks than expected". Can you spot the mistake and fix it?

<Hint>

Are there any limitations on _where_ Hooks may be called? Does this component break any rules? Check if there are any comments disabling the linter checks--this is where the bugs often hide!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [9]}}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    // eslint-disable-next-line
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component function. Here, the first `isSent` definition follows this rule, but the `message` definition is nested in a condition.

Move it out of the condition to fix the issue:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

Remember, Hooks must be called unconditionally and always in the same order!

You could also remove the unnecessary `else` branch to reduce the nesting. However, it's still important that all calls to Hooks happen *before* the first `return`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try moving the second `useState` call after the `if` condition and notice how this breaks it again.

If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), you should see a lint error when you make a mistake like this. If you don't see an error when you try the faulty code locally, you need to set up linting for your project. 

</Solution>

#### Remove unnecessary state {/*remove-unnecessary-state*/}

When the button is clicked, this example should ask for the user's name and then display an alert greeting them. You tried to use state to keep the name, but for some reason the first time it shows "Hello, !", and then "Hello, [name]!" with the previous input every time after.

To fix this code, remove the unnecessary state variable. (We will discuss about [why this didn't work](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) later.)

Can you explain why this state variable was unnecessary?

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleClick() {
    setName(prompt('What is your name?'));
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Here is a fixed version that uses a regular `name` variable declared in the function that needs it:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

A state variable is only necessary to keep information between re-renders of a component. Within a single event handler, a regular variable will do fine. Don't introduce state variables when a regular variable works well.

</Solution>

title: Render and Commit
---

<Intro>

Before your components are displayed on screen, they must be rendered by React. Understanding the steps in this process will help you think about how your code executes and explain its behavior.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* What rendering means in React
* When and why React renders a component
* The steps involved in displaying a component on screen
* Why rendering does not always produce a DOM update

</YouWillLearn>

Imagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders. This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:

1. **Triggering** a render (delivering the guest's order to the kitchen)
2. **Rendering** the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
3. **Committing** to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

<IllustrationBlock sequential>
  <Illustration caption="Trigger" alt="React as a server in a restaurant, fetching orders from the users and delivering them to the Component Kitchen." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render-and-commit1.png" />
  <Illustration caption="Render" alt="The Card Chef gives React a fresh Card component." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render-and-commit2.png" />
  <Illustration caption="Commit" alt="React delivers the Card to the user at their table." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render-and-commit3.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

## Step 1: Trigger a render {/*step-1-trigger-a-render*/}

There are two reasons for a component to render:

1. It's the component's **initial render.**
2. The component's (or one of its ancestors') **state has been updated.**

### Initial render {/*initial-render*/}

When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render. Frameworks and sandboxes sometimes hide this code, but it's done by calling [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) with the target DOM node, and then calling its `render` method with your component:

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);
```

```js src/Image.js
export default function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try commenting out the `root.render()` call and see the component disappear!

### Re-renders when state updates {/*re-renders-when-state-updates*/}

Once the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further renders by updating its state with the [`set` function.](/reference/react/useState#setstate) Updating your component's state automatically queues a render. (You can imagine these as a restaurant guest ordering tea, dessert, and all sorts of things after putting in their first order, depending on the state of their thirst or hunger.)

<IllustrationBlock sequential>
  <Illustration caption="State update..." alt="React as a server in a restaurant, serving a Card UI to the user, represented as a patron with a cursor for their head. The patron expresses they want a pink card, not a black one!" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_rerender1.png" />
  <Illustration caption="...triggers..." alt="React returns to the Component Kitchen and tells the Card Chef they need a pink Card." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_rerender2.png" />
  <Illustration caption="...render!" alt="The Card Chef gives React the pink Card." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_rerender3.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

## Step 2: React renders your components {/*step-2-react-renders-your-components*/}

After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. **"Rendering" is React calling your components.**

* **On initial render,** React will call the root component.
* **For subsequent renders,** React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.

This process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render _that_ component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render _that_ component next, and so on. The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen.

In the following example, React will call `Gallery()` and `Image()` several times:

<Sandpack>

```js src/Gallery.js active
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1>

* **During the initial render,** React will [create the DOM nodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) for `<section>`, `<h1>`, and three `<img>` tags. 
* **During a re-render,** React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won't do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase.

<Pitfall>

Rendering must always be a [pure calculation](/learn/keeping-components-pure):

* **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. (When someone orders a salad with tomatoes, they should not receive a salad with onions!)
* **It minds its own business.** It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering. (One order should not change anyone else's order.)

Otherwise, you can encounter confusing bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows in complexity. When developing in "Strict Mode", React calls each component's function twice, which can help surface mistakes caused by impure functions.

</Pitfall>

<DeepDive>

#### Optimizing performance {/*optimizing-performance*/}

The default behavior of rendering all components nested within the updated component is not optimal for performance if the updated component is very high in the tree. If you run into a performance issue, there are several opt-in ways to solve it described in the [Performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html) section. **Don't optimize prematurely!**

</DeepDive>

## Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM {/*step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom*/}

After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.

* **For the initial render,** React will use the [`appendChild()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
* **For re-renders,** React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.

**React only changes the DOM nodes if there's a difference between renders.** For example, here is a component that re-renders with different props passed from its parent every second. Notice how you can add some text into the `<input>`, updating its `value`, but the text doesn't disappear when the component re-renders:

<Sandpack>

```js src/Clock.js active
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/App.js hidden
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock.js';

function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return time;
}

export default function App() {
  const time = useTime();
  return (
    <Clock time={time.toLocaleTimeString()} />
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

This works because during this last step, React only updates the content of `<h1>` with the new `time`. It sees that the `<input>` appears in the JSX in the same place as last time, so React doesn't touch the `<input>`—or its `value`!
## Epilogue: Browser paint {/*epilogue-browser-paint*/}

After rendering is done and React updated the DOM, the browser will repaint the screen. Although this process is known as "browser rendering", we'll refer to it as "painting" to avoid confusion throughout the docs.

<Illustration alt="A browser painting 'still life with card element'." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_browser-paint.png" />

<Recap>

* Any screen update in a React app happens in three steps:
  1. Trigger
  2. Render
  3. Commit
* You can use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components
* React does not touch the DOM if the rendering result is the same as last time

title: State as a Snapshot
---

<Intro>

State variables might look like regular JavaScript variables that you can read and write to. However, state behaves more like a snapshot. Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How setting state triggers re-renders
* When and how state updates
* Why state does not update immediately after you set it
* How event handlers access a "snapshot" of the state

</YouWillLearn>

## Setting state triggers renders {/*setting-state-triggers-renders*/}

You might think of your user interface as changing directly in response to the user event like a click. In React, it works a little differently from this mental model. On the previous page, you saw that [setting state requests a re-render](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) from React. This means that for an interface to react to the event, you need to *update the state*.

In this example, when you press "send", `setIsSent(true)` tells React to re-render the UI:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hi!');
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Your message is on its way!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      setIsSent(true);
      sendMessage(message);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

function sendMessage(message) {
  // ...
}
```

```css
label, textarea { margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; }
```

</Sandpack>

Here's what happens when you click the button:

1. The `onSubmit` event handler executes.
2. `setIsSent(true)` sets `isSent` to `true` and queues a new render.
3. React re-renders the component according to the new `isSent` value.

Let's take a closer look at the relationship between state and rendering.

## Rendering takes a snapshot in time {/*rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time*/}

["Rendering"](/learn/render-and-commit#step-2-react-renders-your-components) means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated **using its state at the time of the render.**

Unlike a photograph or a movie frame, the UI "snapshot" you return is interactive. It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers. As a result, pressing a button will trigger the click handler from your JSX.

When React re-renders a component:

1. React calls your function again.
2. Your function returns a new JSX snapshot.
3. React then updates the screen to match the snapshot your function returned.

<IllustrationBlock sequential>
    <Illustration caption="React executing the function" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render1.png" />
    <Illustration caption="Calculating the snapshot" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render2.png" />
    <Illustration caption="Updating the DOM tree" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_render3.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

As a component's memory, state is not like a regular variable that disappears after your function returns. State actually "lives" in React itself--as if on a shelf!--outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated **using the state values from that render!**

<IllustrationBlock sequential>
  <Illustration caption="You tell React to update the state" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_state-snapshot1.png" />
  <Illustration caption="React updates the state value" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_state-snapshot2.png" />
  <Illustration caption="React passes a snapshot of the state value into the component" src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_state-snapshot3.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

Here's a little experiment to show you how this works. In this example, you might expect that clicking the "+3" button would increment the counter three times because it calls `setNumber(number + 1)` three times.

See what happens when you click the "+3" button:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice that `number` only increments once per click!

**Setting state only changes it for the *next* render.** During the first render, `number` was `0`. This is why, in *that render's* `onClick` handler, the value of `number` is still `0` even after `setNumber(number + 1)` was called:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

Here is what this button's click handler tells React to do:

1. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
    - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
2. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
    - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.
3. `setNumber(number + 1)`: `number` is `0` so `setNumber(0 + 1)`.
    - React prepares to change `number` to `1` on the next render.

Even though you called `setNumber(number + 1)` three times, in *this render's* event handler `number` is always `0`, so you set the state to `1` three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with `number` equal to `1` rather than `3`.

You can also visualize this by mentally substituting state variables with their values in your code. Since the `number` state variable is `0` for *this render*, its event handler looks like this:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

For the next render, `number` is `1`, so *that render's* click handler looks like this:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

This is why clicking the button again will set the counter to `2`, then to `3` on the next click, and so on.

## State over time {/*state-over-time*/}

Well, that was fun. Try to guess what clicking this button will alert:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        alert(number);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

If you use the substitution method from before, you can guess that the alert shows "0":

```js
setNumber(0 + 5);
alert(0);
```

But what if you put a timer on the alert, so it only fires _after_ the component re-rendered? Would it say "0" or "5"? Have a guess!

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setTimeout(() => {
          alert(number);
        }, 3000);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

Surprised? If you use the substitution method, you can see the "snapshot" of the state passed to the alert.

```js
setNumber(0 + 5);
setTimeout(() => {
  alert(0);
}, 3000);
```

The state stored in React may have changed by the time the alert runs, but it was scheduled using a snapshot of the state at the time the user interacted with it!

**A state variable's value never changes within a render,** even if its event handler's code is asynchronous. Inside *that render's* `onClick`, the value of `number` continues to be `0` even after `setNumber(number + 5)` was called. Its value was "fixed" when React "took the snapshot" of the UI by calling your component.

Here is an example of how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes. Below is a form that sends a message with a five-second delay. Imagine this scenario:

1. You press the "Send" button, sending "Hello" to Alice.
2. Before the five-second delay ends, you change the value of the "To" field to "Bob".

What do you expect the `alert` to display? Would it display, "You said Hello to Alice"? Or would it display, "You said Hello to Bob"? Make a guess based on what you know, and then try it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [to, setTo] = useState('Alice');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert(`You said ${message} to ${to}`);
    }, 5000);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        To:{' '}
        <select
          value={to}
          onChange={e => setTo(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="Alice">Alice</option>
          <option value="Bob">Bob</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
label, textarea { margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; }
```

</Sandpack>

**React keeps the state values "fixed" within one render's event handlers.** You don't need to worry whether the state has changed while the code is running.

But what if you wanted to read the latest state before a re-render? You'll want to use a [state updater function](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates), covered on the next page!

<Recap>

* Setting state requests a new render.
* React stores state outside of your component, as if on a shelf.
* When you call `useState`, React gives you a snapshot of the state *for that render*.
* Variables and event handlers don't "survive" re-renders. Every render has its own event handlers.
* Every render (and functions inside it) will always "see" the snapshot of the state that React gave to *that* render.
* You can mentally substitute state in event handlers, similarly to how you think about the rendered JSX.
* Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render in which they were created.

#### Implement a traffic light {/*implement-a-traffic-light*/}

Here is a crosswalk light component that toggles when the button is pressed:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function TrafficLight() {
  const [walk, setWalk] = useState(true);

  function handleClick() {
    setWalk(!walk);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Change to {walk ? 'Stop' : 'Walk'}
      </button>
      <h1 style={{
        color: walk ? 'darkgreen' : 'darkred'
      }}>
        {walk ? 'Walk' : 'Stop'}
      </h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
h1 { margin-top: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Add an `alert` to the click handler. When the light is green and says "Walk", clicking the button should say "Stop is next". When the light is red and says "Stop", clicking the button should say "Walk is next".

Does it make a difference whether you put the `alert` before or after the `setWalk` call?

<Solution>

Your `alert` should look like this:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function TrafficLight() {
  const [walk, setWalk] = useState(true);

  function handleClick() {
    setWalk(!walk);
    alert(walk ? 'Stop is next' : 'Walk is next');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Change to {walk ? 'Stop' : 'Walk'}
      </button>
      <h1 style={{
        color: walk ? 'darkgreen' : 'darkred'
      }}>
        {walk ? 'Walk' : 'Stop'}
      </h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
h1 { margin-top: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Whether you put it before or after the `setWalk` call makes no difference. That render's value of `walk` is fixed. Calling `setWalk` will only change it for the *next* render, but will not affect the event handler from the previous render.

This line might seem counter-intuitive at first:

```js
alert(walk ? 'Stop is next' : 'Walk is next');
```

But it makes sense if you read it as: "If the traffic light shows 'Walk now', the message should say 'Stop is next.'" The `walk` variable inside your event handler matches that render's value of `walk` and does not change.

You can verify that this is correct by applying the substitution method. When `walk` is `true`, you get:

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setWalk(false);
  alert('Stop is next');
}}>
  Change to Stop
</button>
<h1 style={{color: 'darkgreen'}}>
  Walk
</h1>
```

So clicking "Change to Stop" queues a render with `walk` set to `false`, and alerts "Stop is next".

</Solution>

title: Queueing a Series of State Updates
---

<Intro>

Setting a state variable will queue another render. But sometimes you might want to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next render. To do this, it helps to understand how React batches state updates.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* What "batching" is and how React uses it to process multiple state updates
* How to apply several updates to the same state variable in a row

</YouWillLearn>

## React batches state updates {/*react-batches-state-updates*/}

You might expect that clicking the "+3" button will increment the counter three times because it calls `setNumber(number + 1)` three times:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

However, as you might recall from the previous section, [each render's state values are fixed](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time), so the value of `number` inside the first render's event handler is always `0`, no matter how many times you call `setNumber(1)`:

```js
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
```

But there is one other factor at play here. **React waits until *all* code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.** This is why the re-render only happens *after* all these `setNumber()` calls.

This might remind you of a waiter taking an order at the restaurant. A waiter doesn't run to the kitchen at the mention of your first dish! Instead, they let you finish your order, let you make changes to it, and even take orders from other people at the table.

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_react-batching.png"  alt="An elegant cursor at a restaurant places and order multiple times with React, playing the part of the waiter. After she calls setState() multiple times, the waiter writes down the last one she requested as her final order." />

This lets you update multiple state variables--even from multiple components--without triggering too many [re-renders.](/learn/render-and-commit#re-renders-when-state-updates) But this also means that the UI won't be updated until _after_ your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as **batching,** makes your React app run much faster. It also avoids dealing with confusing "half-finished" renders where only some of the variables have been updated.

**React does not batch across *multiple* intentional events like clicks**--each click is handled separately. Rest assured that React only does batching when it's generally safe to do. This ensures that, for example, if the first button click disables a form, the second click would not submit it again.

## Updating the same state multiple times before the next render {/*updating-the-same-state-multiple-times-before-the-next-render*/}

It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the *next state value* like `setNumber(number + 1)`, you can pass a *function* that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like `setNumber(n => n + 1)`. It is a way to tell React to "do something with the state value" instead of just replacing it.

Try incrementing the counter now:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

Here, `n => n + 1` is called an **updater function.** When you pass it to a state setter:

1. React queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run.
2. During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state.

```js
setNumber(n => n + 1);
setNumber(n => n + 1);
setNumber(n => n + 1);
```

Here's how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler:

1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
1. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.

When you call `useState` during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous `number` state was `0`, so that's what React passes to the first updater function as the `n` argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as `n`, and so on:

|  queued update | `n` | returns |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| `n => n + 1` | `0` | `0 + 1 = 1` |
| `n => n + 1` | `1` | `1 + 1 = 2` |
| `n => n + 1` | `2` | `2 + 1 = 3` |

React stores `3` as the final result and returns it from `useState`.

This is why clicking "+3" in the above example correctly increments the value by 3.
### What happens if you update state after replacing it {/*what-happens-if-you-update-state-after-replacing-it*/}

What about this event handler? What do you think `number` will be in the next render?

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}>
```

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>Increase the number</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

Here's what this event handler tells React to do:

1. `setNumber(number + 5)`: `number` is `0`, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds *"replace with `5`"* to its queue.
2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an updater function. React adds *that function* to its queue.

During the next render, React goes through the state queue:

|   queued update       | `n` | returns |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "replace with `5`" | `0` (unused) | `5` |
| `n => n + 1` | `5` | `5 + 1 = 6` |

React stores `6` as the final result and returns it from `useState`. 

<Note>

You may have noticed that `setState(5)` actually works like `setState(n => 5)`, but `n` is unused!

</Note>

### What happens if you replace state after updating it {/*what-happens-if-you-replace-state-after-updating-it*/}

Let's try one more example. What do you think `number` will be in the next render?

```js
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
  setNumber(42);
}}>
```

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(42);
      }}>Increase the number</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```css
button { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px; }
h1 { display: inline-block; margin: 10px; width: 30px; text-align: center; }
```

</Sandpack>

Here's how React works through these lines of code while executing this event handler:

1. `setNumber(number + 5)`: `number` is `0`, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds *"replace with `5`"* to its queue.
2. `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an updater function. React adds *that function* to its queue.
3. `setNumber(42)`: React adds *"replace with `42`"* to its queue.

During the next render, React goes through the state queue:

|   queued update       | `n` | returns |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "replace with `5`" | `0` (unused) | `5` |
| `n => n + 1` | `5` | `5 + 1 = 6` |
| "replace with `42`" | `6` (unused) | `42` |

Then React stores `42` as the final result and returns it from `useState`.

To summarize, here's how you can think of what you're passing to the `setNumber` state setter:

* **An updater function** (e.g. `n => n + 1`) gets added to the queue.
* **Any other value** (e.g. number `5`) adds "replace with `5`" to the queue, ignoring what's already queued.

After the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so **updater functions must be [pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure)** and only *return* the result. Don't try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects. In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes.

### Naming conventions {/*naming-conventions*/}

It's common to name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable:

```js
setEnabled(e => !e);
setLastName(ln => ln.reverse());
setFriendCount(fc => fc * 2);
```

If you prefer more verbose code, another common convention is to repeat the full state variable name, like `setEnabled(enabled => !enabled)`, or to use a prefix like `setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled)`.

<Recap>

* Setting state does not change the variable in the existing render, but it requests a new render.
* React processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called batching.
* To update some state multiple times in one event, you can use `setNumber(n => n + 1)` updater function.

</Recap>

#### Fix a request counter {/*fix-a-request-counter*/}

You're working on an art marketplace app that lets the user submit multiple orders for an art item at the same time. Each time the user presses the "Buy" button, the "Pending" counter should increase by one. After three seconds, the "Pending" counter should decrease, and the "Completed" counter should increase.

However, the "Pending" counter does not behave as intended. When you press "Buy", it decreases to `-1` (which should not be possible!). And if you click fast twice, both counters seem to behave unpredictably.

Why does this happen? Fix both counters.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function RequestTracker() {
  const [pending, setPending] = useState(0);
  const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(0);

  async function handleClick() {
    setPending(pending + 1);
    await delay(3000);
    setPending(pending - 1);
    setCompleted(completed + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h3>
        Pending: {pending}
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Completed: {completed}
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Buy     
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  });
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Inside the `handleClick` event handler, the values of `pending` and `completed` correspond to what they were at the time of the click event. For the first render, `pending` was `0`, so `setPending(pending - 1)` becomes `setPending(-1)`, which is wrong. Since you want to *increment* or *decrement* the counters, rather than set them to a concrete value determined during the click, you can instead pass the updater functions:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function RequestTracker() {
  const [pending, setPending] = useState(0);
  const [completed, setCompleted] = useState(0);

  async function handleClick() {
    setPending(p => p + 1);
    await delay(3000);
    setPending(p => p - 1);
    setCompleted(c => c + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h3>
        Pending: {pending}
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Completed: {completed}
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Buy     
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  });
}
```

</Sandpack>

This ensures that when you increment or decrement a counter, you do it in relation to its *latest* state rather than what the state was at the time of the click.

</Solution>

#### Implement the state queue yourself {/*implement-the-state-queue-yourself*/}

In this challenge, you will reimplement a tiny part of React from scratch! It's not as hard as it sounds.

Scroll through the sandbox preview. Notice that it shows **four test cases.** They correspond to the examples you've seen earlier on this page. Your task is to implement the `getFinalState` function so that it returns the correct result for each of those cases. If you implement it correctly, all four tests should pass.

You will receive two arguments: `baseState` is the initial state (like `0`), and the `queue` is an array which contains a mix of numbers (like `5`) and updater functions (like `n => n + 1`) in the order they were added.

Your task is to return the final state, just like the tables on this page show!

<Hint>

If you're feeling stuck, start with this code structure:

```js
export function getFinalState(baseState, queue) {
  let finalState = baseState;

  for (let update of queue) {
    if (typeof update === 'function') {
      // TODO: apply the updater function
    } else {
      // TODO: replace the state
    }
  }

  return finalState;
}
```

Fill out the missing lines!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js src/processQueue.js active
export function getFinalState(baseState, queue) {
  let finalState = baseState;

  // TODO: do something with the queue...

  return finalState;
}
```

```js src/App.js
import { getFinalState } from './processQueue.js';

function increment(n) {
  return n + 1;
}
increment.toString = () => 'n => n+1';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <TestCase
        baseState={0}
        queue={[1, 1, 1]}
        expected={1}
      />

        expected={42}
      />
    </>
  );
}

function TestCase({
  baseState,
  queue,
  expected
}) {
  const actual = getFinalState(baseState, queue);
  return (
    <>
      <p>Base state: <b>{baseState}</b></p>
      <p>Queue: <b>[{queue.join(', ')}]</b></p>
      <p>Expected result: <b>{expected}</b></p>
      <p style={{
        color: actual === expected ?
          'green' :
          'red'
      }}>
        Your result: <b>{actual}</b>
        {' '}
        ({actual === expected ?
          'correct' :
          'wrong'
        })
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

This is the exact algorithm described on this page that React uses to calculate the final state:

<Sandpack>

```js src/processQueue.js active
export function getFinalState(baseState, queue) {
  let finalState = baseState;

  for (let update of queue) {
    if (typeof update === 'function') {
      // Apply the updater function.
      finalState = update(finalState);
    } else {
      // Replace the next state.
      finalState = update;
    }
  }

  return finalState;
}
```

```js src/App.js
import { getFinalState } from './processQueue.js';

function increment(n) {
  return n + 1;
}
increment.toString = () => 'n => n+1';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <TestCase
        baseState={0}
        queue={[1, 1, 1]}
        expected={1}
      />
      <hr />
      <TestCase
        baseState={0}
        queue={[
          increment,
          increment,
          increment
        ]}
        expected={3}
      />
      <hr />
      <TestCase
        baseState={0}
        queue={[
          5,
          increment,
        ]}
        expected={6}
      />
      <hr />
      <TestCase
        baseState={0}
        queue={[
          5,
          increment,
          42,
        ]}
        expected={42}
      />
    </>
  );
}

function TestCase({
  baseState,
  queue,
  expected
}) {
  const actual = getFinalState(baseState, queue);
  return (
    <>
      <p>Base state: <b>{baseState}</b></p>
      <p>Queue: <b>[{queue.join(', ')}]</b></p>
      <p>Expected result: <b>{expected}</b></p>
      <p style={{
        color: actual === expected ?
          'green' :
          'red'
      }}>
        Your result: <b>{actual}</b>
        {' '}
        ({actual === expected ?
          'correct' :
          'wrong'
        })
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

title: Updating Objects in State
---

<Intro>

State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn't change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

- How to correctly update an object in React state
- How to update a nested object without mutating it
- What immutability is, and how not to break it
- How to make object copying less repetitive with Immer

</YouWillLearn>

## What's a mutation? {/*whats-a-mutation*/}

You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

```js
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
```

So far you've been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are "immutable", meaning unchangeable or "read-only". You can trigger a re-render to _replace_ a value:

```js
setX(5);
```

The `x` state changed from `0` to `5`, but the _number `0` itself_ did not change. It's not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.

Now consider an object in state:

```js
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

Technically, it is possible to change the contents of _the object itself_. **This is called a mutation:**

```js
position.x = 5;
```

However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them **as if** they were immutable--like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.

## Treat state as read-only {/*treat-state-as-read-only*/}

In other words, you should **treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.**

This example holds an object in state to represent the current pointer position. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial position:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [11]}}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });
  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e => {
        position.x = e.clientX;
        position.y = e.clientY;
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The problem is with this bit of code.

```js
onPointerMove={e => {
  position.x = e.clientX;
  position.y = e.clientY;
}}
```

This code modifies the object assigned to `position` from [the previous render.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time) But without using the state setting function, React has no idea that object has changed. So React does not do anything in response. It's like trying to change the order after you've already eaten the meal. While mutating state can work in some cases, we don't recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only.

To actually [trigger a re-render](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#setting-state-triggers-renders) in this case, **create a *new* object and pass it to the state setting function:**

```js
onPointerMove={e => {
  setPosition({
    x: e.clientX,
    y: e.clientY
  });
}}
```

With `setPosition`, you're telling React:

* Replace `position` with this new object
* And render this component again

Notice how the red dot now follows your pointer when you touch or hover over the preview area:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });
  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY
        });
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<DeepDive>

#### Local mutation is fine {/*local-mutation-is-fine*/}

Code like this is a problem because it modifies an *existing* object in state:

```js
position.x = e.clientX;
position.y = e.clientY;
```

But code like this is **absolutely fine** because you're mutating a fresh object you have *just created*:

```js
const nextPosition = {};
nextPosition.x = e.clientX;
nextPosition.y = e.clientY;
setPosition(nextPosition);
```

In fact, it is completely equivalent to writing this:

```js
setPosition({
  x: e.clientX,
  y: e.clientY
});
```

Mutation is only a problem when you change *existing* objects that are already in state. Mutating an object you've just created is okay because *no other code references it yet.* Changing it isn't going to accidentally impact something that depends on it. This is called a "local mutation". You can even do local mutation [while rendering.](/learn/keeping-components-pure#local-mutation-your-components-little-secret) Very convenient and completely okay!

</DeepDive>  

## Copying objects with the spread syntax {/*copying-objects-with-the-spread-syntax*/}

In the previous example, the `position` object is always created fresh from the current cursor position. But often, you will want to include *existing* data as a part of the new object you're creating. For example, you may want to update *only one* field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields.

These input fields don't work because the `onChange` handlers mutate the state:

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [11, 15, 19]}}
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    person.firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    person.lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    person.email = e.target.value;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleEmailChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

For example, this line mutates the state from a past render:

```js
person.firstName = e.target.value;
```

The reliable way to get the behavior you're looking for is to create a new object and pass it to `setPerson`. But here, you want to also **copy the existing data into it** because only one of the fields has changed:

```js
setPerson({
  firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input
  lastName: person.lastName,
  email: person.email
});
```

You can use the `...` [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals) syntax so that you don't need to copy every property separately.

```js
setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy the old fields
  firstName: e.target.value // But override this one
});
```

Now the form works! 

Notice how you didn't declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms, keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient--as long as you update it correctly!

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      firstName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      email: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleEmailChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Note that the `...` spread syntax is "shallow"--it only copies things one level deep. This makes it fast, but it also means that if you want to update a nested property, you'll have to use it more than once. 

<DeepDive>

#### Using a single event handler for multiple fields {/*using-a-single-event-handler-for-multiple-fields*/}

You can also use the `[` and `]` braces inside your object definition to specify a property with a dynamic name. Here is the same example, but with a single event handler instead of three different ones:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  function handleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      [e.target.name]: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          name="firstName"
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>

## Updating a nested object {/*updating-a-nested-object*/}

Consider a nested object structure like this:

```js
const [person, setPerson] = useState({
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: {
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
  }
});
```

If you wanted to update `person.artwork.city`, it's clear how to do it with mutation:

```js
person.artwork.city = 'New Delhi';
```

But in React, you treat state as immutable! In order to change `city`, you would first need to produce the new `artwork` object (pre-populated with data from the previous one), and then produce the new `person` object which points at the new `artwork`:

```js
const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi' };
const nextPerson = { ...person, artwork: nextArtwork };
setPerson(nextPerson);
```

Or, written as a single function call:

```js
setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy other fields
  artwork: { // but replace the artwork
    ...person.artwork, // with the same one
    city: 'New Delhi' // but in New Delhi!
  }
});
```

This gets a bit wordy, but it works fine for many cases:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      name: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        title: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        city: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        image: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:

#### Objects are not really nested {/*objects-are-not-really-nested*/}

An object like this appears "nested" in code:

```js
let obj = {
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: {
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
  }
};
```

However, "nesting" is an inaccurate way to think about how objects behave. When the code executes, there is no such thing as a "nested" object. You are really looking at two different objects:

```js
let obj1 = {
  title: 'Blue Nana',
  city: 'Hamburg',
  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
};

let obj2 = {
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: obj1
};
```

The `obj1` object is not "inside" `obj2`. For example, `obj3` could "point" at `obj1` too:

```js
let obj1 = {
  title: 'Blue Nana',
  city: 'Hamburg',
  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
};

let obj2 = {
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: obj1
};

let obj3 = {
  name: 'Copycat',
  artwork: obj1
};
```

If you were to mutate `obj3.artwork.city`, it would affect both `obj2.artwork.city` and `obj1.city`. This is because `obj3.artwork`, `obj2.artwork`, and `obj1` are the same object. This is difficult to see when you think of objects as "nested". Instead, they are separate objects "pointing" at each other with properties.

### Write concise update logic with Immer {/*write-concise-update-logic-with-immer*/}

If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider [flattening it.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-deeply-nested-state) But, if you don't want to change your state structure, you might prefer a shortcut to nested spreads. [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) is a popular library that lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. With Immer, the code you write looks like you are "breaking the rules" and mutating an object:

```js
updatePerson(draft => {
  draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';
});
```

But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn't overwrite the past state!

<DeepDive>

#### How does Immer work? {/*how-does-immer-work*/}

The `draft` provided by Immer is a special type of object, called a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), that "records" what you do with it. This is why you can mutate it freely as much as you like! Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the `draft` have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits.

</DeepDive>

To try Immer:

1. Run `npm install use-immer` to add Immer as a dependency
2. Then replace `import { useState } from 'react'` with `import { useImmer } from 'use-immer'`

Here is the above example converted to Immer:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, updatePerson] = useImmer({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.name = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.artwork.title = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.artwork.city = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e) {
    updatePerson(draft => {
      draft.artwork.image = e.target.value;
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </label>

        Image:

      <img 
        src={person.artwork.image} 
        alt={person.artwork.title}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```json package.json

  "dependencies": {
    "immer": "1.7.3",

}

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; }
img { width: 200px; height: 200px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Notice how much more concise the event handlers have become. You can mix and match `useState` and `useImmer` in a single component as much as you like. Immer is a great way to keep the update handlers concise, especially if there's nesting in your state, and copying objects leads to repetitive code.

<DeepDive>

#### Why is mutating state not recommended in React? {/*why-is-mutating-state-not-recommended-in-react*/}

There are a few reasons:

* **Debugging:** If you use `console.log` and don't mutate state, your past logs won't get clobbered by the more recent state changes. So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders.
* **Optimizations:** Common React [optimization strategies](/reference/react/memo) rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If `prevObj === obj`, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.
* **New Features:** The new React features we're building rely on state being [treated like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) If you're mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features.
* **Requirement Changes:** Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on.
* **Simpler Implementation:** Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many "reactive" solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state--no matter how large--without additional performance or correctness pitfalls.

In practice, you can often "get away" with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind. Future contributors and perhaps even your future self will thank you!

</DeepDive>

<Recap>

* Treat all state in React as immutable.
* When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders and will change the state in previous render "snapshots".
* Instead of mutating an object, create a *new* version of it, and trigger a re-render by setting state to it.
* You can use the `{...obj, something: 'newValue'}` object spread syntax to create copies of objects.
* Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep.
* To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from the place you're updating.
* To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer.

#### Fix incorrect state updates {/*fix-incorrect-state-updates*/}

This form has a few bugs. Click the button that increases the score a few times. Notice that it does not increase. Then edit the first name, and notice that the score has suddenly "caught up" with your changes. Finally, edit the last name, and notice that the score has disappeared completely.

Your task is to fix all of these bugs. As you fix them, explain why each of them happens.

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [11]}}

    lastName: 'Shettar',
    score: 10,
  });

  function handlePlusClick() {
    player.score++;
  }

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      firstName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({

  return (

<Solution>

Here is a version with both bugs fixed:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Scoreboard() {
  const [player, setPlayer] = useState({
    firstName: 'Ranjani',
    lastName: 'Shettar',
    score: 10,
  });

  function handlePlusClick() {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      score: player.score + 1,
    });
  }

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      firstName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Score: <b>{player.score}</b>
        {' '}
        <button onClick={handlePlusClick}>
          +1
        </button>
      </label>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={player.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={player.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label { display: block; }
input { margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The problem with `handlePlusClick` was that it mutated the `player` object. As a result, React did not know that there's a reason to re-render, and did not update the score on the screen. This is why, when you edited the first name, the state got updated, triggering a re-render which _also_ updated the score on the screen.

The problem with `handleLastNameChange` was that it did not copy the existing `...player` fields into the new object. This is why the score got lost after you edited the last name.

</Solution>

#### Find and fix the mutation {/*find-and-fix-the-mutation*/}

There is a draggable box on a static background. You can change the box's color using the select input.

But there is a bug. If you move the box first, and then change its color, the background (which isn't supposed to move!) will "jump" to the box position. But this should not happen: the `Background`'s `position` prop is set to `initialPosition`, which is `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`. Why is the background moving after the color change?

Find the bug and fix it.

<Hint>

If something unexpected changes, there is a mutation. Find the mutation in `App.js` and fix it.

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The problem was in the mutation inside `handleMove`. It mutated `shape.position`, but that's the same object that `initialPosition` points at. This is why both the shape and the background move. (It's a mutation, so the change doesn't reflect on the screen until an unrelated update--the color change--triggers a re-render.)

The fix is to remove the mutation from `handleMove`, and use the spread syntax to copy the shape. Note that `+=` is a mutation, so you need to rewrite it to use a regular `+` operation.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import Background from './Background.js';

  x: 0,
  y: 0

    position: initialPosition
  });

  function handleMove(dx, dy) {
    setShape({
      ...shape,
      position: {
        x: shape.position.x + dx,
        y: shape.position.y + dy,
      }
    });
  }

  function handleColorChange(e) {
    setShape({
      ...shape,

#### Update an object with Immer {/*update-an-object-with-immer*/}

This is the same buggy example as in the previous challenge. This time, fix the mutation by using Immer. For your convenience, `useImmer` is already imported, so you need to change the `shape` state variable to use it.

<Sandpack>

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [18]}} src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';
import Background from './Background.js';
import Box from './Box.js';

const initialPosition = {
  x: 0,
  y: 0
};

export default function Canvas() {
  const [shape, setShape] = useState({
    color: 'orange',
    position: initialPosition
  });

  function handleMove(dx, dy) {
    shape.position.x += dx;
    shape.position.y += dy;
  }

  function handleColorChange(e) {
    setShape({
      ...shape,
      color: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <select
        value={shape.color}
        onChange={handleColorChange}
      >
        <option value="orange">orange</option>

      </Box>
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/Box.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Box({
  children,
  color,
  position,
  onMove
}) {
  const [
    lastCoordinates,
    setLastCoordinates
  ] = useState(null);

  function handlePointerDown(e) {
    e.target.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);
    setLastCoordinates({
      x: e.clientX,
      y: e.clientY,
    });
  }

  function handlePointerMove(e) {
    if (lastCoordinates) {
      setLastCoordinates({
        x: e.clientX,

      const dx = e.clientX - lastCoordinates.x;
      const dy = e.clientY - lastCoordinates.y;
      onMove(dx, dy);
    }
  }

  function handlePointerUp(e) {
    setLastCoordinates(null);
  }

  return (
    <div

<Solution>

This is the solution rewritten with Immer. Notice how the event handlers are written in a mutating fashion, but the bug does not occur. This is because under the hood, Immer never mutates the existing objects.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';

const initialPosition = {
  x: 0,

};

export default function Canvas() {
  const [shape, updateShape] = useImmer({
    color: 'orange',
    position: initialPosition
  });

  function handleMove(dx, dy) {
    updateShape(draft => {
      draft.position.x += dx;
      draft.position.y += dy;
    });
  }

  function handleColorChange(e) {
    updateShape(draft => {
      draft.color = e.target.value;

title: Updating Arrays in State
---

<Intro>

Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but you should treat them as immutable when you store them in state. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

- How to add, remove, or change items in an array in React state
- How to update an object inside of an array
- How to make array copying less repetitive with Immer

</YouWillLearn>

## Updating arrays without mutation {/*updating-arrays-without-mutation*/}

In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. [Like with objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state), **you should treat arrays in React state as read-only.** This means that you shouldn't reassign items inside an array like `arr[0] = 'bird'`, and you also shouldn't use methods that mutate the array, such as `push()` and `pop()`.

Instead, every time you want to update an array, you'll want to pass a *new* array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like `filter()` and `map()`. Then you can set your state to the resulting new array.

Here is a reference table of common array operations. When dealing with arrays inside React state, you will need to avoid the methods in the left column, and instead prefer the methods in the right column:

|           | avoid (mutates the array)           | prefer (returns a new array)                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| adding    | `push`, `unshift`                   | `concat`, `[...arr]` spread syntax ([example](#adding-to-an-array)) |
| removing  | `pop`, `shift`, `splice`            | `filter`, `slice` ([example](#removing-from-an-array))              |
| replacing | `splice`, `arr[i] = ...` assignment | `map` ([example](#replacing-items-in-an-array))                     |
| sorting   | `reverse`, `sort`                   | copy the array first ([example](#making-other-changes-to-an-array)) |

Alternatively, you can [use Immer](#write-concise-update-logic-with-immer) which lets you use methods from both columns.

<Pitfall>

Unfortunately, [`slice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) and [`splice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) are named similarly but are very different:

* `slice` lets you copy an array or a part of it.
* `splice` **mutates** the array (to insert or delete items).

In React, you will be using `slice` (no `p`!) a lot more often because you don't want to mutate objects or arrays in state. [Updating Objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) explains what mutation is and why it's not recommended for state.

</Pitfall>

### Adding to an array {/*adding-to-an-array*/}

`push()` will mutate an array, which you don't want:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        artists.push({
          id: nextId++,
          name: name,
        });
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-left: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Instead, create a *new* array which contains the existing items *and* a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the `...` [array spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_array_literals) syntax:

```js
setArtists( // Replace the state
  [ // with a new array
    ...artists, // that contains all the old items
    { id: nextId++, name: name } // and one new item at the end
  ]
);
```

Now it works correctly:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setArtists([
          ...artists,
          { id: nextId++, name: name }
        ]);
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-left: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it *before* the original `...artists`:

```js
setArtists([
  { id: nextId++, name: name },
  ...artists // Put old items at the end
]);
```

In this way, spread can do the job of both `push()` by adding to the end of an array and `unshift()` by adding to the beginning of an array. Try it in the sandbox above!

### Removing from an array {/*removing-from-an-array*/}

The easiest way to remove an item from an array is to *filter it out*. In other words, you will produce a new array that will not contain that item. To do this, use the `filter` method, for example:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let initialArtists = [
  { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'},
  { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'},
];

export default function List() {
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState(
    initialArtists
  );

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>
            {artist.name}{' '}
            <button onClick={() => {
              setArtists(
                artists.filter(a =>
                  a.id !== artist.id
                )
              );
            }}>
              Delete
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Click the "Delete" button a few times, and look at its click handler.

```js
setArtists(
  artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)
);
```

Here, `artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)` means "create an array that consists of those `artists` whose IDs are different from `artist.id`". In other words, each artist's "Delete" button will filter _that_ artist out of the array, and then request a re-render with the resulting array. Note that `filter` does not modify the original array.

### Transforming an array {/*transforming-an-array*/}

If you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use `map()` to create a **new** array. The function you will pass to `map` can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both).

In this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 50 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using `map()`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let initialShapes = [
  { id: 0, type: 'circle', x: 50, y: 100 },
  { id: 1, type: 'square', x: 150, y: 100 },
  { id: 2, type: 'circle', x: 250, y: 100 },
];

export default function ShapeEditor() {
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState(
    initialShapes
  );

  function handleClick() {
    const nextShapes = shapes.map(shape => {
      if (shape.type === 'square') {
        // No change
        return shape;
      } else {
        // Return a new circle 50px below
        return {
          ...shape,
          y: shape.y + 50,
        };
      }
    });
    // Re-render with the new array
    setShapes(nextShapes);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Move circles down!
      </button>
      {shapes.map(shape => (
        <div
          key={shape.id}
          style={{
          background: 'purple',
          position: 'absolute',
          left: shape.x,
          top: shape.y,
          borderRadius:
            shape.type === 'circle'
              ? '50%' : '',
          width: 20,
          height: 20,
        }} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
body { height: 300px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### Replacing items in an array {/*replacing-items-in-an-array*/}

It is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like `arr[0] = 'bird'` are mutating the original array, so instead you'll want to use `map` for this as well.

To replace an item, create a new array with `map`. Inside your `map` call, you will receive the item index as the second argument. Use it to decide whether to return the original item (the first argument) or something else:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let initialCounters = [
  0, 0, 0
];

export default function CounterList() {
  const [counters, setCounters] = useState(
    initialCounters
  );

  function handleIncrementClick(index) {
    const nextCounters = counters.map((c, i) => {
      if (i === index) {
        // Increment the clicked counter
        return c + 1;
      } else {
        // The rest haven't changed
        return c;
      }
    });
    setCounters(nextCounters);
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {counters.map((counter, i) => (
        <li key={i}>
          {counter}
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncrementClick(i);
          }}>+1</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### Inserting into an array {/*inserting-into-an-array*/}

Sometimes, you may want to insert an item at a particular position that's neither at the beginning nor at the end. To do this, you can use the `...` array spread syntax together with the `slice()` method. The `slice()` method lets you cut a "slice" of the array. To insert an item, you will create an array that spreads the slice _before_ the insertion point, then the new item, and then the rest of the original array.

In this example, the Insert button always inserts at the index `1`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 3;
const initialArtists = [
  { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'},
  { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'},
];

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState(
    initialArtists
  );

  function handleClick() {
    const insertAt = 1; // Could be any index
    const nextArtists = [
      // Items before the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(0, insertAt),
      // New item:
      { id: nextId++, name: name },
      // Items after the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(insertAt)
    ];
    setArtists(nextArtists);
    setName('');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Insert
      </button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

### Making other changes to an array {/*making-other-changes-to-an-array*/}

There are some things you can't do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like `map()` and `filter()` alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript `reverse()` and `sort()` methods are mutating the original array, so you can't use them directly.

**However, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it.**

For example:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies' },
  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape' },
  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army' },
];

export default function List() {
  const [list, setList] = useState(initialList);

  function handleClick() {
    const nextList = [...list];
    nextList.reverse();
    setList(nextList);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Reverse
      </button>
      <ul>
        {list.map(artwork => (
          <li key={artwork.id}>{artwork.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Here, you use the `[...list]` spread syntax to create a copy of the original array first. Now that you have a copy, you can use mutating methods like `nextList.reverse()` or `nextList.sort()`, or even assign individual items with `nextList[0] = "something"`.

However, **even if you copy an array, you can't mutate existing items _inside_ of it directly.** This is because copying is shallow--the new array will contain the same items as the original one. So if you modify an object inside the copied array, you are mutating the existing state. For example, code like this is a problem.

```js
const nextList = [...list];
nextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]
setList(nextList);
```

Although `nextList` and `list` are two different arrays, **`nextList[0]` and `list[0]` point to the same object.** So by changing `nextList[0].seen`, you are also changing `list[0].seen`. This is a state mutation, which you should avoid! You can solve this issue in a similar way to [updating nested JavaScript objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#updating-a-nested-object)--by copying individual items you want to change instead of mutating them. Here's how.

## Updating objects inside arrays {/*updating-objects-inside-arrays*/}

Objects are not _really_ located "inside" arrays. They might appear to be "inside" in code, but each object in an array is a separate value, to which the array "points". This is why you need to be careful when changing nested fields like `list[0]`. Another person's artwork list may point to the same element of the array!

**When updating nested state, you need to create copies from the point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top level.** Let's see how this works.

In this example, two separate artwork lists have the same initial state. They are supposed to be isolated, but because of a mutation, their state is accidentally shared, and checking a box in one list affects the other list:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 3;
const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies', seen: false },
  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape', seen: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army', seen: true },
];

export default function BucketList() {
  const [myList, setMyList] = useState(initialList);
  const [yourList, setYourList] = useState(
    initialList
  );

  function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    const myNextList = [...myList];
    const artwork = myNextList.find(
      a => a.id === artworkId
    );
    artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    setMyList(myNextList);
  }

  function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    const yourNextList = [...yourList];
    const artwork = yourNextList.find(
      a => a.id === artworkId
    );
    artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    setYourList(yourNextList);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Art Bucket List</h1>
      <h2>My list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={myList}
        onToggle={handleToggleMyList} />
      <h2>Your list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={yourList}
        onToggle={handleToggleYourList} />
    </>
  );
}

function ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {artworks.map(artwork => (
        <li key={artwork.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={artwork.seen}
              onChange={e => {
                onToggle(
                  artwork.id,
                  e.target.checked
                );
              }}
            />
            {artwork.title}
          </label>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

The problem is in code like this:

```js
const myNextList = [...myList];
const artwork = myNextList.find(a => a.id === artworkId);
artwork.seen = nextSeen; // Problem: mutates an existing item
setMyList(myNextList);
```

Although the `myNextList` array itself is new, the *items themselves* are the same as in the original `myList` array. So changing `artwork.seen` changes the *original* artwork item. That artwork item is also in `yourList`, which causes the bug. Bugs like this can be difficult to think about, but thankfully they disappear if you avoid mutating state.

**You can use `map` to substitute an old item with its updated version without mutation.**

```js
setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {
  if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
    // Create a *new* object with changes
    return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
  } else {
    // No changes
    return artwork;
  }
}));
```

Here, `...` is the object spread syntax used to [create a copy of an object.](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#copying-objects-with-the-spread-syntax)

With this approach, none of the existing state items are being mutated, and the bug is fixed:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 3;
const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies', seen: false },
  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape', seen: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army', seen: true },
];

export default function BucketList() {
  const [myList, setMyList] = useState(initialList);
  const [yourList, setYourList] = useState(
    initialList
  );

  function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {
      if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
        // Create a *new* object with changes
        return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
      } else {
        // No changes
        return artwork;
      }
    }));
  }

  function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    setYourList(yourList.map(artwork => {
      if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
        // Create a *new* object with changes
        return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
      } else {
        // No changes
        return artwork;
      }
    }));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Art Bucket List</h1>
      <h2>My list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={myList}
        onToggle={handleToggleMyList} />
      <h2>Your list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={yourList}
        onToggle={handleToggleYourList} />
    </>
  );
}

function ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {artworks.map(artwork => (
        <li key={artwork.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={artwork.seen}
              onChange={e => {
                onToggle(
                  artwork.id,
                  e.target.checked
                );
              }}
            />
            {artwork.title}
          </label>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

In general, **you should only mutate objects that you have just created.** If you were inserting a *new* artwork, you could mutate it, but if you're dealing with something that's already in state, you need to make a copy.

### Write concise update logic with Immer {/*write-concise-update-logic-with-immer*/}

Updating nested arrays without mutation can get a little bit repetitive. [Just as with objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state#write-concise-update-logic-with-immer):

- Generally, you shouldn't need to update state more than a couple of levels deep. If your state objects are very deep, you might want to [restructure them differently](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-deeply-nested-state) so that they are flat.
- If you don't want to change your state structure, you might prefer to use [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer), which lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you.

Here is the Art Bucket List example rewritten with Immer:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';

let nextId = 3;
const initialList = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies', seen: false },
  { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape', seen: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army', seen: true },
];

export default function BucketList() {
  const [myList, updateMyList] = useImmer(
    initialList
  );
  const [yourList, updateYourList] = useImmer(
    initialList
  );

  function handleToggleMyList(id, nextSeen) {
    updateMyList(draft => {
      const artwork = draft.find(a =>
        a.id === id
      );
      artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    });
  }

  function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    updateYourList(draft => {
      const artwork = draft.find(a =>
        a.id === artworkId
      );
      artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Art Bucket List</h1>
      <h2>My list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={myList}
        onToggle={handleToggleMyList} />
      <h2>Your list of art to see:</h2>
      <ItemList
        artworks={yourList}
        onToggle={handleToggleYourList} />
    </>
  );
}

function ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {artworks.map(artwork => (
        <li key={artwork.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={artwork.seen}
              onChange={e => {
                onToggle(
                  artwork.id,
                  e.target.checked
                );
              }}
            />
            {artwork.title}
          </label>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```json package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "immer": "1.7.3",
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",
    "react-scripts": "latest",
    "use-immer": "0.5.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

Note how with Immer, **mutation like `artwork.seen = nextSeen` is now okay:**

```js
updateMyTodos(draft => {
  const artwork = draft.find(a => a.id === artworkId);
  artwork.seen = nextSeen;
});
```

This is because you're not mutating the _original_ state, but you're mutating a special `draft` object provided by Immer. Similarly, you can apply mutating methods like `push()` and `pop()` to the content of the `draft`.

Behind the scenes, Immer always constructs the next state from scratch according to the changes that you've done to the `draft`. This keeps your event handlers very concise without ever mutating state.

<Recap>

- You can put arrays into state, but you can't change them.
- Instead of mutating an array, create a *new* version of it, and update the state to it.
- You can use the `[...arr, newItem]` array spread syntax to create arrays with new items.
- You can use `filter()` and `map()` to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items.
- You can use Immer to keep your code concise.

#### Update an item in the shopping cart {/*update-an-item-in-the-shopping-cart*/}

Fill in the `handleIncreaseClick` logic so that pressing "+" increases the corresponding number:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialProducts = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Baklava',
  count: 1,
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Cheese',
  count: 5,
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Spaghetti',
  count: 2,
}];

export default function ShoppingCart() {
  const [
    products,
    setProducts
  ] = useState(initialProducts)

  function handleIncreaseClick(productId) {

  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {products.map(product => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          {product.name}
          {' '}
          (<b>{product.count}</b>)
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncreaseClick(product.id);
          }}>
            +
          </button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can use the `map` function to create a new array, and then use the `...` object spread syntax to create a copy of the changed object for the new array:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialProducts = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Baklava',
  count: 1,
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Cheese',
  count: 5,
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Spaghetti',
  count: 2,
}];

export default function ShoppingCart() {
  const [
    products,
    setProducts
  ] = useState(initialProducts)

  function handleIncreaseClick(productId) {
    setProducts(products.map(product => {
      if (product.id === productId) {
        return {
          ...product,
          count: product.count + 1
        };
      } else {
        return product;
      }
    }))
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {products.map(product => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          {product.name}
          {' '}
          (<b>{product.count}</b>)
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncreaseClick(product.id);
          }}>
            +
          </button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

#### Remove an item from the shopping cart {/*remove-an-item-from-the-shopping-cart*/}

This shopping cart has a working "+" button, but the "–" button doesn't do anything. You need to add an event handler to it so that pressing it decreases the `count` of the corresponding product. If you press "–" when the count is 1, the product should automatically get removed from the cart. Make sure it never shows 0.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialProducts = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Baklava',
  count: 1,
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Cheese',
  count: 5,
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Spaghetti',
  count: 2,
}];

export default function ShoppingCart() {
  const [
    products,
    setProducts
  ] = useState(initialProducts)

  function handleIncreaseClick(productId) {
    setProducts(products.map(product => {
      if (product.id === productId) {
        return {
          ...product,
          count: product.count + 1
        };
      } else {
        return product;
      }
    }))
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {products.map(product => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          {product.name}
          {' '}
          (<b>{product.count}</b>)
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncreaseClick(product.id);
          }}>
            +
          </button>
          <button>
            –
          </button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You can first use `map` to produce a new array, and then `filter` to remove products with a `count` set to `0`:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialProducts = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Baklava',
  count: 1,
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Cheese',
  count: 5,
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Spaghetti',
  count: 2,
}];

export default function ShoppingCart() {
  const [
    products,
    setProducts
  ] = useState(initialProducts)

  function handleIncreaseClick(productId) {
    setProducts(products.map(product => {
      if (product.id === productId) {
        return {
          ...product,
          count: product.count + 1
        };
      } else {
        return product;
      }
    }))
  }

  function handleDecreaseClick(productId) {
    let nextProducts = products.map(product => {
      if (product.id === productId) {
        return {
          ...product,
          count: product.count - 1
        };
      } else {
        return product;
      }
    });
    nextProducts = nextProducts.filter(p =>
      p.count > 0
    );
    setProducts(nextProducts)
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {products.map(product => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          {product.name}
          {' '}
          (<b>{product.count}</b>)
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncreaseClick(product.id);
          }}>
            +
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleDecreaseClick(product.id);
          }}>
            –
          </button>
        </li>

#### Fix the mutations using non-mutative methods {/*fix-the-mutations-using-non-mutative-methods*/}

In this example, all of the event handlers in `App.js` use mutation. As a result, editing and deleting todos doesn't work. Rewrite `handleAddTodo`, `handleChangeTodo`, and `handleDeleteTodo` to use the non-mutative methods:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import AddTodo from './AddTodo.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

let nextId = 3;
const initialTodos = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Buy milk', done: true },
  { id: 1, title: 'Eat tacos', done: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Brew tea', done: false },
];

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAddTodo(title) {
    todos.push({
      id: nextId++,
      title: title,
      done: false
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTodo(nextTodo) {
    const todo = todos.find(t =>
      t.id === nextTodo.id
    );
    todo.title = nextTodo.title;
    todo.done = nextTodo.done;
  }

  function handleDeleteTodo(todoId) {
    const index = todos.findIndex(t =>
      t.id === todoId
    );
    todos.splice(index, 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <AddTodo
        onAddTodo={handleAddTodo}
      />
      <TaskList
        todos={todos}
        onChangeTodo={handleChangeTodo}
        onDeleteTodo={handleDeleteTodo}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/AddTodo.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function AddTodo({ onAddTodo }) {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input
        placeholder="Add todo"
        value={title}
        onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setTitle('');
        onAddTodo(title);
      }}>Add</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```js src/TaskList.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function TaskList({
  todos,
  onChangeTodo,
  onDeleteTodo
}) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          <Task
            todo={todo}
            onChange={onChangeTodo}
            onDelete={onDeleteTodo}
          />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function Task({ todo, onChange, onDelete }) {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  let todoContent;
  if (isEditing) {
    todoContent = (
      <>
        <input
          value={todo.title}

<Solution>

In `handleAddTodo`, you can use the array spread syntax. In `handleChangeTodo`, you can create a new array with `map`. In `handleDeleteTodo`, you can create a new array with `filter`. Now the list works correctly:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import AddTodo from './AddTodo.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

let nextId = 3;
const initialTodos = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Buy milk', done: true },
  { id: 1, title: 'Eat tacos', done: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Brew tea', done: false },
];

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAddTodo(title) {
    setTodos([
      ...todos,
      {
        id: nextId++,
        title: title,
        done: false
      }
    ]);
  }

  function handleChangeTodo(nextTodo) {
    setTodos(todos.map(t => {
      if (t.id === nextTodo.id) {
        return nextTodo;
      } else {
        return t;
      }
    }));
  }

  function handleDeleteTodo(todoId) {
    setTodos(
      todos.filter(t => t.id !== todoId)
    );
  }

  return (
    <>
      <AddTodo
        onAddTodo={handleAddTodo}

#### Fix the mutations using Immer {/*fix-the-mutations-using-immer*/}

This is the same example as in the previous challenge. This time, fix the mutations by using Immer. For your convenience, `useImmer` is already imported, so you need to change the `todos` state variable to use it.

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';
import AddTodo from './AddTodo.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

let nextId = 3;
const initialTodos = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Buy milk', done: true },
  { id: 1, title: 'Eat tacos', done: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Brew tea', done: false },
];

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAddTodo(title) {
    todos.push({
      id: nextId++,
      title: title,
      done: false
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTodo(nextTodo) {
    const todo = todos.find(t =>
      t.id === nextTodo.id
    );
    todo.title = nextTodo.title;
    todo.done = nextTodo.done;
  }

  function handleDeleteTodo(todoId) {
    const index = todos.findIndex(t =>
      t.id === todoId
    );
    todos.splice(index, 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <AddTodo
        onAddTodo={handleAddTodo}
      />
      <TaskList
        todos={todos}
        onChangeTodo={handleChangeTodo}
        onDeleteTodo={handleDeleteTodo}

<Solution>

With Immer, you can write code in the mutative fashion, as long as you're only mutating parts of the `draft` that Immer gives you. Here, all mutations are performed on the `draft` so the code works:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';
import AddTodo from './AddTodo.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

let nextId = 3;
const initialTodos = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Buy milk', done: true },
  { id: 1, title: 'Eat tacos', done: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Brew tea', done: false },
];

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [todos, updateTodos] = useImmer(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAddTodo(title) {
    updateTodos(draft => {
      draft.push({
        id: nextId++,
        title: title,
        done: false
      });
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTodo(nextTodo) {
    updateTodos(draft => {
      const todo = draft.find(t =>
        t.id === nextTodo.id
      );
      todo.title = nextTodo.title;
      todo.done = nextTodo.done;
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTodo(todoId) {
    updateTodos(draft => {
      const index = draft.findIndex(t =>
        t.id === todoId
      );
      draft.splice(index, 1);
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <AddTodo
        onAddTodo={handleAddTodo}
      />
      <TaskList
        todos={todos}
        onChangeTodo={handleChangeTodo}
        onDeleteTodo={handleDeleteTodo}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/AddTodo.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function AddTodo({ onAddTodo }) {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input
        placeholder="Add todo"
        value={title}
        onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setTitle('');
        onAddTodo(title);
      }}>Add</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```js src/TaskList.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function TaskList({
  todos,
  onChangeTodo,
  onDeleteTodo
}) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          <Task
            todo={todo}
            onChange={onChangeTodo}
            onDelete={onDeleteTodo}
          />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function Task({ todo, onChange, onDelete }) {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  let todoContent;
  if (isEditing) {
    todoContent = (
      <>
        <input
          value={todo.title}
          onChange={e => {
            onChange({
              ...todo,
              title: e.target.value
            });
          }} />
        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(false)}>
          Save
        </button>
      </>
    );
  } else {
    todoContent = (
      <>
        {todo.title}
        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}>
          Edit
        </button>
      </>
    );
  }
  return (
    <label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={todo.done}
        onChange={e => {
          onChange({
            ...todo,
            done: e.target.checked
          });
        }}
      />
      {todoContent}
      <button onClick={() => onDelete(todo.id)}>
        Delete
      </button>
    </label>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 5px; }
li { list-style-type: none; }
ul, li { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
```

```json package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "immer": "1.7.3",
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",
    "react-scripts": "latest",
    "use-immer": "0.5.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can also mix and match the mutative and non-mutative approaches with Immer.

For example, in this version `handleAddTodo` is implemented by mutating the Immer `draft`, while `handleChangeTodo` and `handleDeleteTodo` use the non-mutative `map` and `filter` methods:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';
import AddTodo from './AddTodo.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

let nextId = 3;
const initialTodos = [
  { id: 0, title: 'Buy milk', done: true },
  { id: 1, title: 'Eat tacos', done: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Brew tea', done: false },
];

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [todos, updateTodos] = useImmer(
    initialTodos
  );

  function handleAddTodo(title) {
    updateTodos(draft => {
      draft.push({
        id: nextId++,
        title: title,
        done: false
      });
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTodo(nextTodo) {
    updateTodos(todos.map(todo => {
      if (todo.id === nextTodo.id) {
        return nextTodo;
      } else {
        return todo;
      }
    }));
  }

  function handleDeleteTodo(todoId) {
    updateTodos(
      todos.filter(t => t.id !== todoId)
    );
  }

  return (
    <>
      <AddTodo
        onAddTodo={handleAddTodo}
      />
      <TaskList
        todos={todos}
        onChangeTodo={handleChangeTodo}
        onDeleteTodo={handleDeleteTodo}
      />
    </>
  );

        value={title}
        onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setTitle('');
        onAddTodo(title);

        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function Task({ todo, onChange, onDelete }) {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  let todoContent;
  if (isEditing) {

          }} />
        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(false)}>

      </>

      </>
    );
  }
  return (

With Immer, you can pick the style that feels the most natural for each separate case.

title: Reacting to Input with State
---

<Intro>

React provides a declarative way to manipulate the UI. Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly, you describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input. This is similar to how designers think about the UI.

</Intro>

<YouWillLearn>

* How declarative UI programming differs from imperative UI programming
* How to enumerate the different visual states your component can be in
* How to trigger the changes between the different visual states from code

</YouWillLearn>

## How declarative UI compares to imperative {/*how-declarative-ui-compares-to-imperative*/}

When you design UI interactions, you probably think about how the UI *changes* in response to user actions. Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer:

* When you type something into the form, the "Submit" button **becomes enabled.**
* When you press "Submit", both the form and the button **become disabled,** and a spinner **appears.**
* If the network request succeeds, the form **gets hidden,** and the "Thank you" message **appears.**
* If the network request fails, an error message **appears,** and the form **becomes enabled** again.

In **imperative programming,** the above corresponds directly to how you implement interaction. You have to write the exact instructions to manipulate the UI depending on what just happened. Here's another way to think about this: imagine riding next to someone in a car and telling them turn by turn where to go.

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_imperative-ui-programming.png"  alt="In a car driven by an anxious-looking person representing JavaScript, a passenger orders the driver to execute a sequence of complicated turn by turn navigations." />

They don't know where you want to go, they just follow your commands. (And if you get the directions wrong, you end up in the wrong place!) It's called *imperative* because you have to "command" each element, from the spinner to the button, telling the computer *how* to update the UI.

In this example of imperative UI programming, the form is built *without* React. It only uses the browser [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model):

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
async function handleFormSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  disable(textarea);
  disable(button);
  show(loadingMessage);
  hide(errorMessage);
  try {
    await submitForm(textarea.value);
    show(successMessage);
    hide(form);
  } catch (err) {
    show(errorMessage);
    errorMessage.textContent = err.message;
  } finally {

Manipulating the UI imperatively works well enough for isolated examples, but it gets exponentially more difficult to manage in more complex systems. Imagine updating a page full of different forms like this one. Adding a new UI element or a new interaction would require carefully checking all existing code to make sure you haven't introduced a bug (for example, forgetting to show or hide something).

React was built to solve this problem.

In React, you don't directly manipulate the UI--meaning you don't enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you **declare what you want to show,** and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn. It's the driver's job to get you there, and they might even know some shortcuts you haven't considered!

<Illustration src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_declarative-ui-programming.png" alt="In a car driven by React, a passenger asks to be taken to a specific place on the map. React figures out how to do that." />

## Thinking about UI declaratively {/*thinking-about-ui-declaratively*/}

You've seen how to implement a form imperatively above. To better understand how to think in React, you'll walk through reimplementing this UI in React below:

1. **Identify** your component's different visual states
2. **Determine** what triggers those state changes
3. **Represent** the state in memory using `useState`
4. **Remove** any non-essential state variables
5. **Connect** the event handlers to set the state

### Step 1: Identify your component's different visual states {/*step-1-identify-your-components-different-visual-states*/}

In computer science, you may hear about a ["state machine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) being in one of several “states”. If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different "visual states". React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.

First, you need to visualize all the different "states" of the UI the user might see:

* **Empty**: Form has a disabled "Submit" button.
* **Typing**: Form has an enabled "Submit" button.
* **Submitting**: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.
* **Success**: "Thank you" message is shown instead of a form.
* **Error**: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.

Just like a designer, you'll want to "mock up" or create "mocks" for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called `status` with a default value of `'empty'`:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form({
  status = 'empty'
}) {
  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form>
        <textarea />
        <br />
        <button>
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
    </>
  )
}
```

</Sandpack>

You could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important. Try editing `status = 'empty'` to `status = 'success'` to see the success message appear. Mocking lets you quickly iterate on the UI before you wire up any logic. Here is a more fleshed out prototype of the same component, still "controlled" by the `status` prop:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form({
  // Try 'submitting', 'error', 'success':
  status = 'empty'
}) {
  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form>
        <textarea disabled={
          status === 'submitting'
        } />
        <br />
        <button disabled={
          status === 'empty' ||
          status === 'submitting'
        }>
          Submit
        </button>
        {status === 'error' &&
          <p className="Error">
            Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!
          </p>
        }
      </form>
      </>
  );
}
```

```css
.Error { color: red; }
```

</Sandpack>

<DeepDive>

#### Displaying many visual states at once {/*displaying-many-visual-states-at-once*/}

If a component has a lot of visual states, it can be convenient to show them all on one page:

<Sandpack>

```js src/App.js active
import Form from './Form.js';

let statuses = [
  'empty',
  'typing',
  'submitting',
  'success',
  'error',
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {statuses.map(status => (
        <section key={status}>
          <h4>Form ({status}):</h4>
          <Form status={status} />
        </section>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/Form.js
export default function Form({ status }) {
  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <form>
      <textarea disabled={
        status === 'submitting'
      } />
      <br />
      <button disabled={
        status === 'empty' ||
        status === 'submitting'
      }>
        Submit
      </button>
      {status === 'error' &&
        <p className="Error">
          Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!
        </p>
      }
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
section { border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 20px; }
h4 { color: #222; }
body { margin: 0; }
.Error { color: red; }
```

</Sandpack>

Pages like this are often called "living styleguides" or "storybooks".

</DeepDive>

### Step 2: Determine what triggers those state changes {/*step-2-determine-what-triggers-those-state-changes*/}

You can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs:

* **Human inputs,** like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link.
* **Computer inputs,** like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.

<IllustrationBlock>
  <Illustration caption="Human inputs" alt="A finger." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_inputs1.png" />
  <Illustration caption="Computer inputs" alt="Ones and zeroes." src="/images/docs/illustrations/i_inputs2.png" />
</IllustrationBlock>

In both cases, **you must set [state variables](/learn/state-a-components-memory#anatomy-of-usestate) to update the UI.** For the form you're developing, you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs:

* **Changing the text input** (human) should switch it from the *Empty* state to the *Typing* state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.
* **Clicking the Submit button** (human) should switch it to the *Submitting* state.
* **Successful network response** (computer) should switch it to the *Success* state.
* **Failed network response** (computer) should switch it to the *Error* state with the matching error message.

<Note>

Notice that human inputs often require [event handlers](/learn/responding-to-events)!

</Note>

To help visualize this flow, try drawing each state on paper as a labeled circle, and each change between two states as an arrow. You can sketch out many flows this way and sort out bugs long before implementation.

<DiagramGroup>

<Diagram name="responding_to_input_flow" height={350} width={688} alt="Flow chart moving left to right with 5 nodes. The first node labeled 'empty' has one edge labeled 'start typing' connected to a node labeled 'typing'. That node has one edge labeled 'press submit' connected to a node labeled 'submitting', which has two edges. The left edge is labeled 'network error' connecting to a node labeled 'error'. The right edge is labeled 'network success' connecting to a node labeled 'success'.">

</DiagramGroup>

### Step 3: Represent the state in memory with `useState` {/*step-3-represent-the-state-in-memory-with-usestate*/}

Next you'll need to represent the visual states of your component in memory with [`useState`.](/reference/react/useState) Simplicity is key: each piece of state is a "moving piece", and **you want as few "moving pieces" as possible.** More complexity leads to more bugs!

Start with the state that *absolutely must* be there. For example, you'll need to store the `answer` for the input, and the `error` (if it exists) to store the last error:

```js
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
```

Then, you'll need a state variable representing which one of the visual states that you want to display. There's usually more than a single way to represent that in memory, so you'll need to experiment with it.

If you struggle to think of the best way immediately, start by adding enough state that you're *definitely* sure that all the possible visual states are covered:

```js
const [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true);
const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);
```

Your first idea likely won't be the best, but that's ok--refactoring state is a part of the process!

### Step 4: Remove any non-essential state variables {/*step-4-remove-any-non-essential-state-variables*/}

You want to avoid duplication in the state content so you're only tracking what is essential. Spending a little time on refactoring your state structure will make your components easier to understand, reduce duplication, and avoid unintended meanings. Your goal is to **prevent the cases where the state in memory doesn't represent any valid UI that you'd want a user to see.** (For example, you never want to show an error message and disable the input at the same time, or the user won't be able to correct the error!)

Here are some questions you can ask about your state variables:

* **Does this state cause a paradox?** For example, `isTyping` and `isSubmitting` can't both be `true`. A paradox usually means that the state is not constrained enough. There are four possible combinations of two booleans, but only three correspond to valid states. To remove the "impossible" state, you can combine these into a `status` that must be one of three values: `'typing'`, `'submitting'`, or `'success'`.
* **Is the same information available in another state variable already?** Another paradox: `isEmpty` and `isTyping` can't be `true` at the same time. By making them separate state variables, you risk them going out of sync and causing bugs. Fortunately, you can remove `isEmpty` and instead check `answer.length === 0`.
* **Can you get the same information from the inverse of another state variable?** `isError` is not needed because you can check `error !== null` instead.

After this clean-up, you're left with 3 (down from 7!) *essential* state variables:

```js
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing'); // 'typing', 'submitting', or 'success'
```

You know they are essential, because you can't remove any of them without breaking the functionality.

<DeepDive>

#### Eliminating “impossible” states with a reducer {/*eliminating-impossible-states-with-a-reducer*/}

These three variables are a good enough representation of this form's state. However, there are still some intermediate states that don't fully make sense. For example, a non-null `error` doesn't make sense when `status` is `'success'`. To model the state more precisely, you can [extract it into a reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) Reducers let you unify multiple state variables into a single object and consolidate all the related logic!

</DeepDive>

### Step 5: Connect the event handlers to set state {/*step-5-connect-the-event-handlers-to-set-state*/}

Lastly, create event handlers that update the state. Below is the final form, with all event handlers wired up:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');

  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus('submitting');
    try {
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus('success');
    } catch (err) {
      setStatus('typing');
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextareaChange(e) {
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <textarea
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextareaChange}
          disabled={status === 'submitting'}
        />
        <br />
        <button disabled={
          answer.length === 0 ||
          status === 'submitting'
        }>
          Submit
        </button>
        {error !== null &&
          <p className="Error">
            {error.message}
          </p>
        }
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // Pretend it's hitting the network.
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== 'lima'
      if (shouldError) {
        reject(new Error('Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!'));
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}
```

```css
.Error { color: red; }
```

</Sandpack>

Although this code is longer than the original imperative example, it is much less fragile. Expressing all interactions as state changes lets you later introduce new visual states without breaking existing ones. It also lets you change what should be displayed in each state without changing the logic of the interaction itself.

<Recap>

* Declarative programming means describing the UI for each visual state rather than micromanaging the UI (imperative).
* When developing a component:
  1. Identify all its visual states.
  2. Determine the human and computer triggers for state changes.
  3. Model the state with `useState`.
  4. Remove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.
  5. Connect the event handlers to set state.

</Recap>

#### Add and remove a CSS class {/*add-and-remove-a-css-class*/}

Make it so that clicking on the picture *removes* the `background--active` CSS class from the outer `<div>`, but *adds* the `picture--active` class to the `<img>`. Clicking the background again should restore the original CSS classes.

Visually, you should expect that clicking on the picture removes the purple background and highlights the picture border. Clicking outside the picture highlights the background, but removes the picture border highlight.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Picture() {
  return (
    <div className="background background--active">
      <img
        className="picture"
        alt="Rainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/5qwVYb1.jpeg"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }

.background {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background: #eee;
}

.background--active {
  background: #a6b5ff;
}

.picture {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 5px solid transparent;
}

.picture--active {
  border: 5px solid #a6b5ff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

This component has two visual states: when the image is active, and when the image is inactive:

* When the image is active, the CSS classes are `background` and `picture picture--active`.
* When the image is inactive, the CSS classes are `background background--active` and `picture`.

A single boolean state variable is enough to remember whether the image is active. The original task was to remove or add CSS classes. However, in React you need to *describe* what you want to see rather than *manipulate* the UI elements. So you need to calculate both CSS classes based on the current state. You also need to [stop the propagation](/learn/responding-to-events#stopping-propagation) so that clicking the image doesn't register as a click on the background.

Verify that this version works by clicking the image and then outside of it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Picture() {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  let backgroundClassName = 'background';
  let pictureClassName = 'picture';
  if (isActive) {
    pictureClassName += ' picture--active';
  } else {
    backgroundClassName += ' background--active';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={backgroundClassName}
      onClick={() => setIsActive(false)}
    >
      <img
        onClick={e => {
          e.stopPropagation();
          setIsActive(true);
        }}
        className={pictureClassName}
        alt="Rainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/5qwVYb1.jpeg"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }

.background {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background: #eee;
}

.background--active {
  background: #a6b5ff;
}

.picture {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 5px solid transparent;
}

.picture--active {
  border: 5px solid #a6b5ff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Alternatively, you could return two separate chunks of JSX:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Picture() {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  if (isActive) {
    return (
      <div
        className="background"
        onClick={() => setIsActive(false)}
      >
        <img
          className="picture picture--active"
          alt="Rainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia"
          src="https://i.imgur.com/5qwVYb1.jpeg"
          onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
  return (
    <div className="background background--active">
      <img
        className="picture"
        alt="Rainbow houses in Kampung Pelangi, Indonesia"
        src="https://i.imgur.com/5qwVYb1.jpeg"
        onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 250px; }

.background {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background: #eee;
}

.background--active {
  background: #a6b5ff;
}

.picture {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 5px solid transparent;
}

.picture--active {
  border: 5px solid #a6b5ff;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Keep in mind that if two different JSX chunks describe the same tree, their nesting (first `<div>` → first `<img>`) has to line up. Otherwise, toggling `isActive` would recreate the whole tree below and [reset its state.](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) This is why, if a similar JSX tree gets returned in both cases, it is better to write them as a single piece of JSX.

#### Profile editor {/*profile-editor*/}

Here is a small form implemented with plain JavaScript and DOM. Play with it to understand its behavior:

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
function handleFormSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (editButton.textContent === 'Edit Profile') {
    editButton.textContent = 'Save Profile';
    hide(firstNameText);
    hide(lastNameText);
    show(firstNameInput);
    show(lastNameInput);
  } else {
    editButton.textContent = 'Edit Profile';
    hide(firstNameInput);
    hide(lastNameInput);
    show(firstNameText);
    show(lastNameText);
  }
}

function handleFirstNameChange() {
  firstNameText.textContent = firstNameInput.value;
  helloText.textContent = (
    'Hello ' +
    firstNameInput.value + ' ' +
    lastNameInput.value + '!'
  );
}

function handleLastNameChange() {
  lastNameText.textContent = lastNameInput.value;
  helloText.textContent = (
    'Hello ' +
    firstNameInput.value + ' ' +
    lastNameInput.value + '!'
  );
}

function hide(el) {
  el.style.display = 'none';
}

function show(el) {
  el.style.display = '';
}

let form = document.getElementById('form');
let editButton = document.getElementById('editButton');
let firstNameInput = document.getElementById('firstNameInput');
let firstNameText = document.getElementById('firstNameText');
let lastNameInput = document.getElementById('lastNameInput');
let lastNameText = document.getElementById('lastNameText');
let helloText = document.getElementById('helloText');
form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;
firstNameInput.oninput = handleFirstNameChange;
lastNameInput.oninput = handleLastNameChange;
```

```js sandbox.config.json hidden
{
  "hardReloadOnChange": true
}
```

```html public/index.html
<form id="form">
  <label>
    First name:
    <b id="firstNameText">Jane</b>
    <input
      id="firstNameInput"
      value="Jane"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <label>
    Last name:
    <b id="lastNameText">Jacobs</b>
    <input
      id="lastNameInput"
      value="Jacobs"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <button type="submit" id="editButton">Edit Profile</button>
  <p><i id="helloText">Hello, Jane Jacobs!</i></p>
</form>

<style>
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 20px; padding: 0; }
label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
</style>
```

</Sandpack>

This form switches between two modes: in the editing mode, you see the inputs, and in the viewing mode, you only see the result. The button label changes between "Edit" and "Save" depending on the mode you're in. When you change the inputs, the welcome message at the bottom updates in real time.

Your task is to reimplement it in React in the sandbox below. For your convenience, the markup was already converted to JSX, but you'll need to make it show and hide the inputs like the original does.

Make sure that it updates the text at the bottom, too!

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function EditProfile() {
  return (
    <form>
      <label>
        First name:{' '}
        <b>Jane</b>
        <input />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:{' '}
        <b>Jacobs</b>
        <input />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">
        Edit Profile
      </button>
      <p><i>Hello, Jane Jacobs!</i></p>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

You will need two state variables to hold the input values: `firstName` and `lastName`. You're also going to need an `isEditing` state variable that holds whether to display the inputs or not. You should _not_ need a `fullName` variable because the full name can always be calculated from the `firstName` and the `lastName`.

Finally, you should use [conditional rendering](/learn/conditional-rendering) to show or hide the inputs depending on `isEditing`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function EditProfile() {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Jane');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Jacobs');

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      setIsEditing(!isEditing);
    }}>
      <label>
        First name:{' '}
        {isEditing ? (
          <input
            value={firstName}
            onChange={e => {
              setFirstName(e.target.value)
            }}
          />
        ) : (
          <b>{firstName}</b>
        )}
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:{' '}
        {isEditing ? (
          <input
            value={lastName}
            onChange={e => {
              setLastName(e.target.value)
            }}
          />
        ) : (
          <b>{lastName}</b>
        )}
      </label>
      <button type="submit">
        {isEditing ? 'Save' : 'Edit'} Profile
      </button>
      <p><i>Hello, {firstName} {lastName}!</i></p>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
```

Compare this solution to the original imperative code. How are they different?

#### Refactor the imperative solution without React {/*refactor-the-imperative-solution-without-react*/}

Here is the original sandbox from the previous challenge, written imperatively without React:

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
function handleFormSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (editButton.textContent === 'Edit Profile') {
    editButton.textContent = 'Save Profile';
    hide(firstNameText);
    hide(lastNameText);
    show(firstNameInput);
    show(lastNameInput);
  } else {
    editButton.textContent = 'Edit Profile';
    hide(firstNameInput);
    hide(lastNameInput);
    show(firstNameText);
    show(lastNameText);
  }
}

function handleFirstNameChange() {
  firstNameText.textContent = firstNameInput.value;
  helloText.textContent = (
    'Hello ' +
    firstNameInput.value + ' ' +
    lastNameInput.value + '!'
  );
}

function handleLastNameChange() {
  lastNameText.textContent = lastNameInput.value;
  helloText.textContent = (
    'Hello ' +
    firstNameInput.value + ' ' +
    lastNameInput.value + '!'
  );
}

function hide(el) {
  el.style.display = 'none';
}

function show(el) {
  el.style.display = '';
}

let form = document.getElementById('form');
let editButton = document.getElementById('editButton');
let firstNameInput = document.getElementById('firstNameInput');
let firstNameText = document.getElementById('firstNameText');
let lastNameInput = document.getElementById('lastNameInput');
let lastNameText = document.getElementById('lastNameText');
let helloText = document.getElementById('helloText');
form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;
firstNameInput.oninput = handleFirstNameChange;
lastNameInput.oninput = handleLastNameChange;
```

```js sandbox.config.json hidden
{
  "hardReloadOnChange": true
}
```

```html public/index.html
<form id="form">
  <label>
    First name:
    <b id="firstNameText">Jane</b>
    <input
      id="firstNameInput"
      value="Jane"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <label>
    Last name:
    <b id="lastNameText">Jacobs</b>
    <input
      id="lastNameInput"
      value="Jacobs"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <button type="submit" id="editButton">Edit Profile</button>
  <p><i id="helloText">Hello, Jane Jacobs!</i></p>
</form>

<style>
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 20px; padding: 0; }
label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
</style>
```

</Sandpack>

Imagine React didn't exist. Can you refactor this code in a way that makes the logic less fragile and more similar to the React version? What would it look like if the state was explicit, like in React?

If you're struggling to think where to start, the stub below already has most of the structure in place. If you start here, fill in the missing logic in the `updateDOM` function. (Refer to the original code where needed.)

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
let firstName = 'Jane';
let lastName = 'Jacobs';
let isEditing = false;

function handleFormSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsEditing(!isEditing);
}

function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
  setFirstName(e.target.value);
}

function handleLastNameChange(e) {
  setLastName(e.target.value);
}

function setFirstName(value) {
  firstName = value;
  updateDOM();
}

function setLastName(value) {
  lastName = value;
  updateDOM();
}

function setIsEditing(value) {
  isEditing = value;
  updateDOM();
}

function updateDOM() {
  if (isEditing) {
    editButton.textContent = 'Save Profile';
    // TODO: show inputs, hide content
  } else {
    editButton.textContent = 'Edit Profile';
    // TODO: hide inputs, show content
  }
  // TODO: update text labels
}

function hide(el) {
  el.style.display = 'none';
}

function show(el) {
  el.style.display = '';
}

let form = document.getElementById('form');
let editButton = document.getElementById('editButton');
let firstNameInput = document.getElementById('firstNameInput');
let firstNameText = document.getElementById('firstNameText');
let lastNameInput = document.getElementById('lastNameInput');
let lastNameText = document.getElementById('lastNameText');
let helloText = document.getElementById('helloText');
form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;
firstNameInput.oninput = handleFirstNameChange;
lastNameInput.oninput = handleLastNameChange;
```

```js sandbox.config.json hidden
{
  "hardReloadOnChange": true
}
```

```html public/index.html
<form id="form">
  <label>
    First name:
    <b id="firstNameText">Jane</b>
    <input
      id="firstNameInput"
      value="Jane"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <label>
    Last name:
    <b id="lastNameText">Jacobs</b>
    <input
      id="lastNameInput"
      value="Jacobs"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <button type="submit" id="editButton">Edit Profile</button>
  <p><i id="helloText">Hello, Jane Jacobs!</i></p>
</form>

<style>
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 20px; padding: 0; }
label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
</style>
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

The missing logic included toggling the display of inputs and content, and updating the labels:

<Sandpack>

```js src/index.js active
let firstName = 'Jane';
let lastName = 'Jacobs';
let isEditing = false;

function handleFormSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsEditing(!isEditing);
}

function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
  setFirstName(e.target.value);
}

function handleLastNameChange(e) {
  setLastName(e.target.value);
}

function setFirstName(value) {
  firstName = value;
  updateDOM();
}

function setLastName(value) {
  lastName = value;
  updateDOM();
}

function setIsEditing(value) {
  isEditing = value;
  updateDOM();
}

function updateDOM() {
  if (isEditing) {
    editButton.textContent = 'Save Profile';
    hide(firstNameText);
    hide(lastNameText);
    show(firstNameInput);
    show(lastNameInput);
  } else {
    editButton.textContent = 'Edit Profile';
    hide(firstNameInput);
    hide(lastNameInput);
    show(firstNameText);
    show(lastNameText);
  }
  firstNameText.textContent = firstName;
  lastNameText.textContent = lastName;
  helloText.textContent = (
    'Hello ' +
    firstName + ' ' +
    lastName + '!'
  );
}

function hide(el) {
  el.style.display = 'none';
}

function show(el) {
  el.style.display = '';
}

let form = document.getElementById('form');
let editButton = document.getElementById('editButton');
let firstNameInput = document.getElementById('firstNameInput');
let firstNameText = document.getElementById('firstNameText');
let lastNameInput = document.getElementById('lastNameInput');
let lastNameText = document.getElementById('lastNameText');
let helloText = document.getElementById('helloText');
form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit;
firstNameInput.oninput = handleFirstNameChange;
lastNameInput.oninput = handleLastNameChange;
```

```js sandbox.config.json hidden
{
  "hardReloadOnChange": true
}
```

```html public/index.html
<form id="form">
  <label>
    First name:
    <b id="firstNameText">Jane</b>
    <input
      id="firstNameInput"
      value="Jane"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <label>
    Last name:
    <b id="lastNameText">Jacobs</b>
    <input
      id="lastNameInput"
      value="Jacobs"
      style="display: none">
  </label>
  <button type="submit" id="editButton">Edit Profile</button>
  <p><i id="helloText">Hello, Jane Jacobs!</i></p>
</form>

<style>
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
body { font-family: sans-serif; margin: 20px; padding: 0; }
label { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
</style>
```

</Sandpack>

The `updateDOM` function you wrote shows what React does under the hood when you set the state. (However, React also avoids touching the DOM for properties that have not changed since the last time they were set.)
